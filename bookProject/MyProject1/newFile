a barn owl brought neville a small package from his
a beginners  guide to transfiguration by emeric
a better team than last year  flattened in that last
a biased referee
a bit   said hermione timidly
a bit  well  that s something   ronan sighed  he
a bit lighter   said harry  trying to take ron s mind off
a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms
a bludger at him  hermione  who had all her fingers
a bored  drawling voice   then i m going to drag them
a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small
a braver man than vernon dursley would have
a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive  which
a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair
a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted
a century   said harry  shoveling pie into his
a crowd of confused hufflepuffs  harry suddenly
a cutting from the daily prophet
a disgusting smell filled their nostrils  making both of
a few people laughed  harry caught seamus s eye
a few people nodded mutely
a few seconds later  they were there  outside the
a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore
a foot in the air   several people behind him
a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor  but in all
a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly
a giant of a man was standing in the doorway  his
a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon
a hand on his shoulder and looked up into
a history of magic by bathilda bagshot
a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of
a horrible thought struck harry  as horrible thoughts
a hundred and fifty points lost  that put gryffindor in
a lamp flickered on  it was hermione granger
a large book from under his pillow   got this outta the
a legend   i wouldn t be surprised if today was
a lemon drop  they re a kind of muggle sweet i m
a letter   repeated professor mcgonagall faintly
a little
a little and smiled at the ceiling
a lot of water in the bottom after the storm
a loud  rude sound  like the air being let out of a
a low  soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign
a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
a magic wand       this was what harry had been really
a man appeared on the corner the cat had been
a minute
a moment later they had entered the great hall
a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid
a muggle   said hagrid   it s what we call nonmagic
a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey
a nimbus two thousand   ron moaned enviously
a nimbus two thousand  sir   said harry  fighting
a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors
a pale young man made his way forward  very
a piercing  bloodcurdling shriek split the silence
a pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of
a pound to know that he was holding more money
a rush of fierce joy he realized he d found something
a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform
a second  very small parcel contained a note
a slightly squashed box  harry opened it with
a smarter hat than me
a spiral staircase   they were obviously in one of the
a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever
a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the
a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to
a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the
a television
a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and
a thumpin  good un  i d say  once yeh ve been trained
a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the
a toilet or
a toothless old man came ambling up to them
a trash can and a few weeds
a treasure that was never yours
a tree  the weasley twins and lee jordan were
a troll
a troublesome zombie  but they weren t sure they
a unicorn  they re powerful magic creatures  i never
a very merry christmas to you
a voice echoed through the train   we will be reaching
a weasley sweater
a werewolf   harry suggested
a what
a what   said harry  interested
a whistle sounded
a white pawn had moved forward two squares
a wizard  o  course   said hagrid  sitting back down
aaaaaaaaaaargh
aaaaarrrgh
aaaargh
aaah  has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie
aargh  it s all right  he only got my boot   jus
able to create a body of my own      now     why don t

able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror
abnormal   and then  if you please  she went and got

about a week later
about all these people was the way they seemed to
about anything
about being a wizard or about my parents or
about dragons  look at these  dragon species of great
about four times bigger than he was  harry had a thin
about him
about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his
about it
about it       every odd thing that had ever made his
about it   n not that you n need it  eh  p p potter
about it   said the other twin   once
about magic at all  how can they expect great things
about once a week  uncle vernon looked over the top
about once every ten years   said griphook with a
about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him
about the dark arts  snape
about the end of the holidays  where he could see a
about the special circumstances  potter  and what
about their first lessons  fang rested his head on
about them  you ve got to keep eye contact  and
about through the whirl of rainbow feathers  he
about what finally stopped him
about what i see  that s all
about you stumped him  all right
about yourselves    don t want slytherin to win the
above the trash can
absolutely   said professor mcgonagall crisply   the
absolutely not
accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and
accepted at uncle vernon s old private school
accidents even with both feet on the ground
ache inside him  half joy  half terrible sadness
aconite  well  why aren t you all copying that down
across the board   yes     look
across the grounds  hagrid lived in a small wooden
acted as though any chair with harry in it were
acting in a way it shouldn t  no matter if it was in a
actually spoke
added  voicing for the first time something that had
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of
added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron

admirable cloak back on and get off to bed
admitted   mind you  we did save her
adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts  but

adventure  you know  the stone was really not such a

africa doing something for gringotts   said ron   did
after  what s that dog guarding
after a good night s sleep  harry felt nearly back to
after a meal of turkey sandwiches  crumpets  trifle
after asking harry furiously if he knew the man  aunt
after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in
after fluffy  a dragon would be easy
after lunch they went to the reptile house  it was cool
after snape  s fading footsteps
after taking a lot of complicated notes  they were each
after that
afternoon  throwing down his quill and looking
afternoon and when he left the building at five o clock
again
again
again
again  and one of his grandfathers nodding happily
again  but harry was glad she held herself in as his
again  gryffindor will be in even more trouble
again  he flattened himself against the wall and fell
again  i ll take another fifty points from gryffindor
again  piers and dudley could only gibber  as far as
again  there was a tabby cat standing on the corner
again  won t you  eh   he said  leering at them   oh
again and this time  she lost her temper
again to make sure he had everything he needed  saw
age  she turned and left
ages ago  if we try anything ourselves we ll be thrown
ages back  to take his mind off his nerves about

aha   said harry   so there s someone called nicolas
ahead  through the tangled branches of an ancient
ahead of them  and as percy took a step toward them
ahem   just a few more words now that we are all
ahem   said dumbledore   i have a few last minute
air   you re lucky you weren t killed  why aren t you
air  soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys  they
air  wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could
air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry
air to point at dudley   there was a flash of violet
airplane  and  first time out on his racing bike
ajar to his left  it was his only hope  he squeezed
alas  the first thing you ask me  i cannot tell you
alberic grunnion  circe  paracelsus  and merlin  he
albus dumbled
albus dumbledore
albus dumbledore
albus dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had
albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet  he was
alchemist and opera lover  mr  flamel  who celebrated
alive long enough to drink something else
all
all   all three of us
all   said hermione
all  this would probably be the best christmas he d
all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg
all big and stupid  but as dudley was the biggest and
all come an  find yeh   so  be careful   let s go
all day  not until he climbed into bed was he free to
all day  when you could have been celebrating  i
all evening giving him advice such as  if he tries to
all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell
all harry had to do was keep close behind him  they
all harry s   it was incredible  the dursleys couldn t
all he s done     all the people he s killed     he couldn t
all his homework without her  what with all the last
all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus
all over britain  owls flying by daylight  mysterious
all over the place  it must ve bin staggerin  around
all p places  severus
all right   all right     he heard quirrell sob
all right   harry mumbled   i m getting up
all right   harry whispered
all right   i only came in here because people
all right   please
all right   ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully
all right  all right  flint nearly kills the gryffindor
all right  but i warn yeh  he s a coward   said hagrid
all right  but i warned you  you just remember what
all right  keep your hair on
all right  thirty seven then   said dudley  going red
all right there  harry   he had time to yell  as he
all students should have a copy of each of the
all summer
all the hair
all the same  he d have gambled twelve sorcerer s
all the same  it wasn t what you d call the perfect end
all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the
all until they had climbed two floors up  it was a relief
all was lost  and fell into blackness  down     down
all what   asked harry
all what   hagrid thundered   now wait jus  one
all yours   smiled hagrid
allowed  he sat down next to harry  took one look at
allowed them
almost as many white pieces as they had lost black
almost drop the crate  forgetting that they were
alohomora
alone
alone
alone that night  he had been held up by madam
along  tried to frighten me   as though he could
along the same lines as hermione  they piled so
aloud
already  all right  harry  hermione
already changed into his billowing black hogwarts
already dead was that their sudden appearance had
already got past fluffy
already invisible  they shrank into the shadows
already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped
also carrying a long  thin package and didn t answer
also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that
although he might be warmer if it did  four minutes
always been able to kick him around like a football
always do when you re very nervous  what if he
always the innocent are the first victims   he said
always wanted to shake your hand   i m all of a
am i   said harry  feeling dazed
amazed   weird
an  as fer that cat  mrs  norris  i d like ter introduce
an  dad  an  nicer people yeh couldn t find   anyway
an  dumbledore himself did somethin   o  course
an  follow the trail in diff rent directions  there s blood
an  here s harry   said the giant
an  i ve also got a letter here from professor
an  then     i can  remember too well   cause he kept
an  wizards of the age   the mckinnons  the bones
an eagle  a badger  and a snake surrounding a large
an empty compartment near the end of the train  he
an excuse to stop talking to the boy  hopped down
an old man was standing before them  his wide  pale
an owl hooted loudly  and harry nearly fell out of the
an owl to charlie to ask him
an underground ravine  and harry leaned over the
and   oh harry   be carefull
and a few minutes later  he and harry were up in the
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed
and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door
and a quarter inches long  swishy  made of willow
and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder
and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward
and almost fell  it was a few seconds before mr
and bit into a corner
and bitterly wishing he d opened the letter in the hall
and broke into a run   he tripped  grabbed ron
and broomsticks  might this not all be some huge
and came home every vacation with her pockets full
and candies  the sandwiches lay forgotten
and chaser bell  and speeds toward the   wait a
and christmas cake  everyone felt too full and sleepy
and come back and find the house in ruins   she
and cousin are  though  wish i d had three wizard
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles
and dark in there  with lit windows all along the
and dates  and got emeric the evil and uric the
and decided where your loyalties lie
and did he   did he seem interested in fluffy
and disappeared
and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to
and don t forget  we re not supposed to know about
and don t get in a flap
and down the rows correcting their grips  harry and
and down the table were beside themselves   they
and dragged him off the board  where he lay quite
and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw
and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that
and excited
and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile
and feet  and a long nose
and filch would never know
and finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported
and finally  i must tell you that this year  the third
and firenze whisked around  with harry clutching on
and flat straw hats called boaters  they also carried
and flick  remember  swish and flick  and saying the
and flickering  jewel bright eyes  harry now carried a
and flipped over the postcard
and forests under a deep purple sky  the train did
and found themselves in the gryffindor common
and gave him what must have been a very scratchy
and goblets  at the top of the hall was another long
and gold in the darkness  they edged along the walls
and got his wish at once  the hat had barely touched
and grasped the broom tightly in both hands  and it
and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a
and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley
and harry knew it would be no good to argue
and harry knew that the only reason they weren t
and harry let go  cold  damp air rushed past him as
and harry read on  this specimen was bred in the
and harry s broom spun off course  harry holding on
and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp
and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk
and he accidentally let go  but i bounced   all the
and he couldn t decide which to ask first  after a few
and he said people from muggle families shouldn t
and he scooted off
and her eyes   her eyes are just like mine  harry
and hermione
and hermione shook hands with the others and
and hermione took
and hermione were wondering whether they d ever
and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it
and hung on as tight as he could  quirrell screamed
and hurried off to get plates
and i can cap them all
and i d have got you off that broom  i d have managed
and i didn t get a single pair  people will insist on
and i have been thinking     you re really getting a bit
and i m head boy
and i must trouble you with an old man s wheezing
and i ve got about six of her     do you want it  you
and i want to see all your family  all the weasleys
and i will personally make sure you are expelled
and if it turns red   oh      his face fell  because the
and in the end  hagrid agreed that they could send
and in the end  hermione agreed to run down to
and into the clearing came   was it a man  or a
and into trouble  i ve already caught him  i suppose
and it s really none of your business   said harry
and it s really thanks to malfoy here that i ve got it
and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy
and last ball  compared with the quaffle and the
and learn until our brains all rot
and lily that  they were proud of having a witch in
and look through my books  there might be
and looked at the little bundle  hagrid s shoulders
and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers
and managed to pin it to the ground
and my names malfoy  draco malfoy
and never getting proper birthday presents  this
and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single
and no wonder we couldn t find flamel in that study
and not come back  you have been warned
and now  before we go to bed  let us sing the school
and now there were only four people left to be sorted
and off we go
and over again he dreamed about his parents
and peered down into the front garden  the cat was
and percy s old rat
and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance
and pointed at malfoy  who couldn t have looked more
and pointed his broom handle down   next second
and power   something that will mean you can never
and practice
and pulled on his jeans because he didn t want to
and put the cat out of his mind  as he drove toward
and quills  harry cheered up a bit when he found a
and quirrell  though pinning harry to the ground
and quirrell lunged  knocking harry clean off his feet
and ron didn t talk much  both of them were
and ron pulled harry out of the room
and ron thought was very good for her
and saw other pairs of green eyes like his  other noses
and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile
and scratching his head   d yeh think yer parents
and seamus winked  snape  however  was not
and shaking
and she left  taking the toadless boy with her
and she let ron and hermione in
and she s really belting along up there  a neat pass
and silence  he could go anywhere in this  anywhere
and silver volume caught his eye  he pulled it out
and sir  there s one more thing
and snape  harry moved nearer to the mirror
and snape have said  you ll be expelled
and snarled claws hung from the ceiling  while
and so he had
and something came shooting out of a classroom in
and something white was glinting at the end
and speaking of snape
and sprinted across the room  he expected to feel
and started at once  the minutes crept by
and stepped underneath it themselves   mommy will
and still professor mcgonagall didn t say a word to
and suddenly  their wardrobes were empty  their
and tell me what you see
and that monster  they didn t stop running until they
and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to
and that s where
and that the great hall didn t simply open on to the
and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once
and the old man hugged mr  dursley around the
and the others becoming wizards while he stumped
and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina
and the round faced boy harry had passed on
and the school bellowed
and the scraping of heavy trunks
and the table on the far left exploded with cheers
and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full
and their flushed  sweaty faces
and then  because the smiling lady in the van had
and then  once you had managed to find them  there
and then he realized that his broom was completely
and then said   it begins  i suppose  with   with a
and then the story started to spread  harry potter
and then they heard it   a low grunting  and the
and there s aunt petunia knocking on the door  harry
and there s something else
and there were his mother and father smiling at him
and they couldn t carry on
and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried
and they ran  they almost flew  back down the
and they were in a vast marble hall  about a hundred
and things that wouldn t fit into his first bedroom  it
and thirteen   harry asked
and those too weak to seek it      since then  i have
and thought  and then it came to him  the restricted
and tiptoed toward the trophy room
and to harry s horror  a voice answered  and the voice
and to his relief he managed to get inside the room
and took off  gliding silently over the castle he saw
and tried to throw harry off   the pain in harry s
and tucked it deep inside his coat  harry longed to
and turn up months later in the sahara desert
and turned   it worked  the moment the lock had
and twisted itself  snakelike  into words
and unafraid of toil
and until hagrid told me  i didn t know anything
and very stupid  he took a great running jump and
and warmth  wriggling and flailing  it unraveled itself
and watch out for snape
and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight
and we d better stay outside the third floor corridor
and were off
and what are slytherin and hufflepuff
and what he said instead was   who are you
and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens
and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us
and wider   a second later they were facing an
and wolfsbane
and women   said chaser angelina johnson
and women   wood agreed   this is it
and you could ask your parents if they know who
and you ll be in that cupboard from now until
and you mustn t go wandering around the school
and you re not sitting with the prefects today
and you should have seen their faces when i got in
and you ve got dirt on your nose  by the way  did you
and you wouldn t tell anyone  would you  not even
and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house
angelina   keeper bletchley dives   misses
angry  after all  they normally pretended she didn t
angry  moved into the firelight
angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs
animal  not a toad  toads went outta fashion years
animals side  and began to drink its blood
ankles were too tight  he tripped and fell over  quirrell
anne          and then  at last
another  harry in the lead  without any idea where
another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble
another look
another note from hagrid  he had written only two
another one and harry was allowed to finish the first
another owl  and this could be our only chance to get
another reason for not wanting snape near him while
another staircase  then another   even one of harry s
another time  aunt petunia had been trying to force
another weasley  eh   said hagrid  glancing at ron s
another will transport the drinker back instead
another year gone   dumbledore said cheerfully
answer
answer a teacher s question  she was staring at her
answer back with hedwig
answer out of a centaur  ruddy stargazers  not
anxiously  and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle
any dog needs exercise  that one does
any excuse to knock points off gryffindor
any metal into pure gold  it also produces the elixir of
any money in his life until a month ago  and he told
any more  the evening air had never smelled so
any more points  can it
any second now  professor mcgonagall would come
anymore  can t you see  d you think he ll leave you
anymore  dursley  don  worry
anymore  who cared what the three headed dog was
anyone
anyone else  he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary
anyone sitting there   he asked  pointing at the seat
anyone was listening   don  go shoutin  about it
anyone was wandering around at night  and
anyone was watching  they weren t  he looked back
anyone who d listen about the time he d almost hit a
anyone who had been sent to see him
anyone would want it
anythin  strange
anything
anything
anything  but neither of you are that good at chess
anything  he got some of everything and paid the
anything as horrible as your head down it   it might
anything at all  but as they stepped into it  light
anything else
anything that didn t concern him was put to an
anything to do with the potters  if it did     if it got out
anything to do with work  though  he watched an owl
anything to his wife
anything to share before or  indeed  anyone to share
anyway   harry   said the giant  turning his back
anyway  got y eh this
anyway  we d better go and look for neville s toad
anyway  we ve got to go  lee jordan reckons he s
anyway  what does he know about it  some o  the best

anywhere  but they hardly cared   all they wanted to
apart from you
apothecary  which was fascinating enough to make
appeared  she was leading neville
applause  for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were
approached the giant heads
arching high above them  it was full of small  jewel
archway large enough even for hagrid  an archway
are all a little fuller than they were       you have the

argue  but ron kicked him behind their cauldron
arguing  what looked like a fat little monk was
arm  and he crashed to the floor   hermione
armed
armor  he had been so busy getting away from the
armor near the kitchens  he knew  but he must be
arms like a windmill
around
around  he fell asleep as we was flyin  over bristol
around  you know who won t touch you  anyway
around a bit  but mr  ollivander snatched it out of his
around and spying  he felt so ashamed of himself that
around at everyone   did you hear that  he
around flint  off up the field and   ouch   that
around half past twelve there was a great clattering
around harry and it was just no good telling the
around harry s heart  over the rustling of the trees
around her ankles  as for harry and ron  their legs
around him
around him
around him as he walked
around in pain close by  harry could see a clearing
around like this  people will think you re up to
around our hoops and stop the other team from
around school at night  especially these days  it s very
around the classroom  professor flitwick put the
around the grounds carrying hagrid s bag
around the high chamber
around the huge  oak front door
around the waist  and the pair of them toppled right
around the walls
around the week before  making a list of students
around to see if it was a dragon  but too late   they
around unseen
arrangements
arrived
arrived  he looked around anxiously and saw that
arriving at hagrid  s hut because they d had to wait for
arrow and fitted it into his crossbow  raising it  ready
as air  use it well  the note had said
as best he could  they plunged off into the trees
as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to
as cool as usual   we can t go in there at night
as easily as if it had been made of rubber  and threw
as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest
as hagrid s story came to a close  he saw again the
as harry and ron walked back to the castle for
as harry helped himself to a treacle tart  the talk
as harry s did
as harry stepped forward  whispers suddenly broke
as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet
as he d drawn the curtains of his four poster  harry
as he had expected  mrs  dursley looked shocked and
as he is  does that help
as he left the house  he got into his car and backed
as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers
as he pulled into the driveway of number four  the
as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of
as he spread marmalade on his newspapers   no
as he stoked the fire
as it had been on the night when mr  dursley had
as it went
as much to harry s surprise as anyone else s  there he
as neville walked away  harry looked at the famous
as night fell  the promised storm blew up around
as seven o clock drew nearer  harry left the castle and
as snape limped away   wonder what s wrong with
as the door creaked  low  rumbling growls met their
as the match drew nearer  however  harry became
as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual
as the snake shook its head  a deafening shout
as the snake slid swiftly past him  harry could have
as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour
as they crept nearer
as they entered november  the weather turned very
as usual at the end of practice  but harry headed
aside
ask me      it s just a pity they let the old
ask me questions just now  i think i m gonna be
asked
asked  hoping he sounded offhand
asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry
asked him  saw his scar  it s really there   like
asked if he knew how to get past fluffy   and he said
asked me what i was doing  so i said i was waiting for
asked percy
askew
askin  fer photos     knew yeh didn  have any     d yeh
asking around  and i hope i m in gryffindor  it sounds
asking questions  it was his talking about anything
asleep
asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next
asleep was that even if the potters were involved
astonishment  that dumbledore  s face had
at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall
at eleven o clock that night  they said good bye to ron
at first  gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses
at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting
at five to three they left the castle and made their way
at half past eight  mr  dursley picked up his
at harry
at him  the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it
at his mother   i don t want him in there     i need
at home
at last  a great crunching noise announced hagrid s
at last  norbert was going     going     gone
at last  the desserts too disappeared  and professor
at last she found what she was looking for
at last there was silence again
at malfoy s elbow
at night  think of the points you ll lose gryffindor if
at once  the black ball rose high in the air and then
at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge
at ron  who was still standing with his wand in the
at school  harry had no one  everybody knew that
at stonewall   he told harry   want to come upstairs
at stonewall high   like he was wearing bits of old
at that moment  madam pomfrey bustled over
at that moment a group of people passed just behind
at that moment neville toppled into the common
at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia
at the door  but it wouldn t budge  not even when
at the dragon with misty eyes   he really knows me
at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in
at the famous witches and wizards cards  but harry
at the floor  he wished ron would put his wand down
at the foot of the first set of stairs  they spotted mrs
at the snake  he wouldn t have been surprised if it
at the snake and winked  too
at the start of term banquet  harry had gotten the
at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a
at them  he had just thought of something that made
at these words  hermione seized hagrid  s binoculars
at these words a knight  a bishop  and a castle turned
at this  hermione stood up  her hand stretching
at this  neville let out a little moan  and malfoy
at this moment the boat bumped gently into the
at three thirty that afternoon  harry  ron  and the
ate in the zoo restaurant  and when dudley had a
attract a lot of funny looks  because of hedwig  he d
aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when
aunt and uncle never spoke about them  and of
aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror
aunt petunia looked as though she d just swallowed a
aunt petunia obviously scented danger  too  because
aunt petunia was how he had gotten it
aunt petunia when she asked what he d bought
avoid all the staring eyes  harry looked upward and
await my owl
awake  in a matter of seconds  though  he was wide
awarding  and the points stand thus  in fourth place
away   he closed his eyes ready for the crash
away  all the studying he had to do kept his mind off
away  no trouble  and we continue play  gryffindor
away  there s so much to learn  i m particularly
away from professor flitwick  who had golden
away from the forest
away from them all  at last  hagrid managed to make
away from this place tonight

back and lead him to his doom
back at the dursleys  dark living room window   i
back down by leaning forward slightly  on my whistle
back from the telephone looking both angry and
back in the locker room  wood had taken harry
back into the crate and strapping it down safely   the
back of his seat to help
back on the table
back onto his neck  coughed  and said   so   new
back out  gryffindor can t play at all
back so quickly
back through the wall  back through the leaky
back to bed  all of you  i ve never been more ashamed
back to hagrid  the forest is not safe at this time
back to staring around for the snitch  once he caught
back to taunting harry about having no proper

bane    be happy
bane   do you not understand why it was killed  or
bane kicked his back legs in anger
bane walked over to stand next to ronan  he looked
bane was furious     he was talking about interfering
banner high above  flashing potter for president over

barely whipped round the corner when they heard
barking   said uncle vernon   howling mad  the lot of

barrier  letting them go through the gate in twos and
barrier and then he d be in trouble   leaning forward
bars as he could carry   but the woman didn t have
bartender  who was quite bald and looked like a
bartender reached for a glass  saying   the usual
baseball bat
basking in the warm shallows
bat spleens and eels  eyes  tottering piles of spell

beaming
beaming at harry   professor mcgonagall told me all
beaming at the students  his arms opened wide  as if
beans as they sped past muggle towns  pulling off
beard
beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint
became a ravenclaw and then it was ron s turn  he
became almost impossible to follow because the trees
became quite still again
because harry couldn t sleep  but the truth was that
because he felt that would make him and your father
because he put it back in his pocket and said
because he s a prefect   said their mother fondly   all
because he was no good  but because no one wanted
because his grandmother had never let him near one
because it all seemed to move around a lot  the
because it s so fast and difficult to see  it s the
because it said
because mr  and mrs  weasley were going to romania
because norbert had just bitten him on the leg
because she tried to stop him from killing me  but
because they d stolen his prefect badge
becoming almost unbearable   he s the slytherin
becoming wilder  the neat fields had gone  now there
bed
bed  he tore his eyes away from his mother s face
bed  the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight
bed after a very  very long day  after all  to the well
bedroom    privet drive

been turned into warty toads every time they d tried
been worrying him a lot lately   i bet i m the worst in
before
before  harry  still cheering  nudged ron in the ribs
before  he was walking so fast he knew he was
before he could mention this  hagrid had steered him
before he could say or think anything else  the
before he let them in  and then shut the door quickly
before he noticed anything about the room he had
before he went to sleep  harry ticked off another day
before it  entranced by what they have seen  or been
before next year starts
before ron could answer  professor flitwick appeared
before ron could say another word  hermione had
before the cat moved at all
before them a brilliantly lit chamber  its ceiling
before them and they kept as close as possible to
before were the following words
before you have to be
before you take your seats in the great hall  you will
began to droop  harry hardly drew breath  slowly  the
began to eat  it was all delicious
behind harry made both of them jump   dudley
behind him
behind him  galloping  and something jumped clean
behind him  she didn t even stop to say sorry as she
behind him and turned to face the two boys
behind his paper
behind the black chessmen  which were all taller than
behind the white pieces they could see another door
behind them
behind them
being able to afford an owl  after all  he d never had
being downright careless  out on the streets in broad
being left on the ground  pushed off hard before the
being put on the stove  he rolled onto his back and
believe he worked so hard to protect you this year
believe it     oh  albus
believe it  people who was on his side came back ter
believed this story  for one thing  when seamus
below   marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose
below  in a shadowy clearing  stood snape  but he
bent double  wheezing and spluttering
beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was
best be off  harry  lots ter do today  gotta get up ter
best birthday of his life   and yet   he chewed his
bet it s that one behind the statue of gregory the
bet my broomstick he let that troll in  to make a
bet that was dedalus diggle  he never had much
bet you could   ron muttered
better
better get the cloak   ron muttered  as lee jordan
better hufflepuff than slytherin   said hagrid darkly
better than having to do a spell  but he did wish they
better than what he was leaving behind
better you than me   they said together  but harry
between ceiling and floor  it had three heads  three
between door and floor
between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed
bewildered  at his own palms   harry could see they
bewildered stare
bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies
beyond all we do here  and now  bedtime  off you
bicycle  on a carousel at the fair  playing a computer
big and squashy on the doormat   something alive
big for it       we think it might be nice if you moved

bigger than him or ron
bills to harry so he could buy their tickets
bin hurt   you seen anythin

bits of advice at him  which was confusing   don t
bitterly
black beetle eyes  five knuts a scoop
black haired and  bodied and wilder looking than
black inside of the hat  he waited
black like hagrid  s  but they had none of hagrid  s
black players slumped along the wall  twice  ron only
blame them  not only was hagrid twice as tall as
blankets
blasted thing   snape was saying   how are you
blazing in his eyes  but harry  instead of feeling
bleaaargh   see  sprouts
bless him  look  he knows his mommy   said hagrid

blimey  this is difficult  see  there was this wizard
blinded  he staggered backward  he heard hooves
blinding flash of green light  more clearly than he had
blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his
blink in case he missed it   but just as the boy
blinked and hagrid had gone
blob  and their potion was seeping across the stone
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of
blood here and there along the winding path
bloody and mangled  filch was handing snape

boarded up the cracks around the front and back
bobbing in the iron gray water below them
boiling
boiling on the open fire  and in the corner stood a
boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock

breakfast  circling the tables until they saw their
breakfast table looking tired and rather ill  but happy
breaking another school rule today  on the other
breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her
breaking will lose house points  at the end of the
breath  ron was standing there with his wand still
breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on
breathing down their necks
breathing heavily through her long  pointed nose
breathlessly   he tried to get past that three headed
breaths and then forced his face into a smile  which
breeding was outlawed by the warlocks  convention
breezy day  and the grass rippled under their feet as
briefcase  pecked mrs  dursley on the cheek  and
bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles
bright birds  fluttering and tumbling all around the
bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball
bright tonight

buried deep under london
bursting through the trees  their flanks heaving and
business staying here  we may as well go and join the
busy year   she said
but
but
but a moment later  the reflection smiled at him  it
but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious
but at that moment  hagrid leapt from the sofa and
but before harry could answer  madam malkin said
but below that was a horse s gleaming chestnut body
but don  go rabbitin  about it in here  students aren
but don t judge on what you see
but even quidditch had lost its fun  the rest of the
but everybody else was very pleased when hermione  s
but for my mother and father  oh no  it was lily this
but from that moment on  hermione granger became

but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff
but hagrid simply waved his hand and said   about
but hagrid wasn t listening  he was humming merrily
but harry   what if you know  who s with him
but harry  by instinct  reached up and grabbed
but harry only had one thought in his head  which

but he was very fast
but he wished he hadn t said anything  if there was
but hermione had given harry something else to
but how do we know which to drink
but i don t understand who
but i expect you ve realized by now what it does
but i heard you a few days ago  sobbing   i thought
but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there
but i suppose if they all swooped down at once
but i suppose ravenclaw wouldn t be too bad
but i thought   snape
but if their house was destroyed
but if we get caught  you two will be expelled  too
but if you would move onward  neither is your friend
but instead of looking up at harry  she started

dudley s mouth fell open in horror  but harry s heart
dudley slept  and one where dudley kept all the toys
dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother
dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass
dudley thought for a moment  it looked like hard
dudley to think they liked him
dudley tried to grab the letter to read it  but uncle
dudley was howling  he d never had such a bad day

dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out
dumbledore s eyes twinkled   useful things     your

eyes  and sat down  a moment s pause
eyes  but hermione answered before harry could
eyes  he wore round glasses held together with a lot
eyes  it had been such a good dream
eyes  like pale sapphires  he looked carefully at
eyes  she  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one
eyes and a wide mouth appeared  floating cross
eyes of mrs  norris came round the door  ron and
eyes on the sheet  when he had found his voice again
eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the
eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the
face   and was startled to see that she was in tears
face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his
face  knobbly knees  black hair  and bright green
face and held the broom steady  a few people below
face fell
face harry had ever seen  it was chalk white with
face in his hands   i told the evil git how ter get past

five floors above there
five minutes later  ron and hermione joined him
five minutes to go  harry heard something creak
fix it   course  he shoulda sacked me instead
fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she
flagged stone floor  harry could hear the drone of
flamel  though  have some bacon or something  why
flamel involved  is there
flamel is   said ron   it d be safe to ask them
flames
flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey
flared
flat  horny feet  the smell coming from it was
flavor   you know  you get all the ordinary ones like
flew
flew   said hagrid
flew off and hit the window  all three of them
flicked  but the feather they were supposed to be
flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it
flickering candlelight  dotted here and there among
flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over
flitwick  and snape went to get him  and i ve only
flitwick had just read him
flitwick must ve put charms on the keys  mcgonagall
flooded through him as he stood there in the dark
floor
floor  and now they knew why it was forbidden
floor  burning holes in people s shoes  within
floor  jars of herbs  dried roots  and bright powders
floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds
floor where it lay in gleaming folds  ron gasped
flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to

fluffy
fluffy   he didn t feel much like singing
fluffy  aren t you  hagrid   said harry anxiously
fluffy  i told him  it was the only thing he didn t
fluffy  loads of enchantments  probably  and quirrell
fluffy little bunny rabbit  when it bit me he told me off
flump  with a funny  muffled sort of thump he
flung back his head and stared at the sky   mars is
flushed with their victory  they started to run back

flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky  a

followers as his enemies  nevertheless  harry  while
following

foolish girl  how could you think of tackling a
for

for all this about your parents  well  they were

for being found on the roof of the school kitchens
for dear life
for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down
for frightening it  and when i left  he was singing it a
for harry and ron  too  it was driving them nuts
for i m a thinking cap
for i m the hogwarts sorting hat
for it  he passed filch in the doorway  filch s pale
for nearly an hour
for no reason at all   it s people they feel sorry for
for nothing could upset me today  rejoice  for you
for now they re bare and full of air
for ten minutes during their breaks  harry had even
for the best  what is that to do with us  centaurs
for the best played game of chess hogwarts has
for the family in his brand new uniform  smeltings
for the first time  a spasm of fear flitted across
for the mirror of erised again  and for the rest of the
for the seventh year in a row  a huge banner showing
for those who take  but do not earn
forced the sweater over his head  knocking his glasses
forehead  that was no ordinary cut  that s what yeh
forehead  this  he supposed  was the crash  though
forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning  he
forehead with a long  white finger

forget things   this tells you if there s something
forget wizard baruffio  who said  s  instead of  f and
forgetfulness potion

four broomsticks came swooping down out of the

from a classroom up ahead  as he drew closer  he
from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled
from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror
from behind  the troll couldn t feel harry hanging
from being one of the most popular and admired
from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling
from gryffindor  he sprinted back upstairs
from hermione   if that s what i think it is   they re
from inside and several booming barks  then hagrid  s
from inside the crate came ripping noises that
from it  holding on with only one hand
from muggle families and  like him  hadn t had any
from one of the weasleys  wristwatches  and once a
from screaming  he whirled around  his heart was
from shoulder to finger  then wrist to elbow  shoulder
from the card he d gotten out of the chocolate frog on
from the dog  but hermione had already jumped  she
from the footstool
from the mountain troll  and she was much nicer for
from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from
from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on
from their bodies  and they were able to pull free

gasping for breath  with harry s letter clutched in his
gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring
gateway back to the muggle world  some of them

gave a leap  every year on dudley s birthday  his

glasses  how strange

glasses of sherry  one of them was smoking a long
gleefully  clapping his hands together   and this

gliding across the lake  which was as smooth as

gloatingly at the slytherin table

grandfather  however  old chessmen weren t a
grandmother  he opened it excitedly and showed
granger  hermione
granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed
granger had made any difference to her match
granger was on the edge of her seat and looked
gravy and cranberry sauce   and stacks of wizard
gray and the lake like chilled steel  every morning the
gray hair  and yellow eyes like a hawk
gray rat  which was asleep
greasily   my mistake  my mistake   i didn t see you

great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried
great help   snarled ron  leaning back  trying to stop
great idea though  thanks  mom
great uncle algie came round for dinner  and he was
great wizarding events of the twentieth century
great wizards of the twentieth century  or notable
greatest sorcerer in the world  how come dudley had
greatness  no doubt about that   no  well  if you re
greed  and ambition  sharing his soul with voldemort
green   exactly the same shape  but then he noticed
green and hebridean blacks  the ministry of magic
green ink  there was no stamp
greener and tidier  eating bertie bott s every flavor
greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology

gringotts carts   he did still look a bit sick  so harry
gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had
gringotts to hogwarts  and they spent a lot of time
gringotts was the safest place in the world for
griphook
griphook
griphook held the door open for them  harry  who
griphook unlocked the door  a lot of green smoke
griphook was yet another goblin  once hagrid had
griphook wasn t steering
gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke
gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and

ground and you ve got your little friends with you
ground like some stalking beast  harry  malfoy  and
ground was covered in frost  hagrid could be seen

gryffindor   shouted the hat  ron groaned
gryffindor  weasley  and be grateful it isn t more
gryffindor  with three hundred and twelve points  in
gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together
gryffindor cheers filled the cold air  with howls and
gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling
gryffindor common room and the great hall had
gryffindor for this   said professor mcgonagall   i m
gryffindor found out what they d done
gryffindor had had for the house cup  harry felt as
gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy
gryffindor lion took its place  snape was shaking
gryffindor meant more to you than this  all three of
gryffindor s had in years  we re going to win  i know
gryffindor table  harry  ron  and hermione stood up
gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that
gryffindor team   said malfoy loudly a few minutes
gryffindors  i hope you re going to help us win the
gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders
gryffindors score
guardin  the high security vaults  and then yeh gotta
guarding  really   hermione went on   we wondered
guarding  what did it matter if snape stole it  really
guarding something        what had hagrid said
guarding vaults in the wizards  bank  if they met a
gulpin  gargoyles  harry  people are still scared
gun out of uncle vernon s hands  bent it into a knot
h  potter  the floor  hut on the rock  the sea  he
had a pretty good idea we were going to try  and
had a very strange dream  he was wearing professor
had already agreed they d better not ask madam
had already been bound tightly in long creepers
had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the
had an idea that snape wouldn t refuse if there were
had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy
had been a good one  there had been a flying
had been broken at least twice  this man s name was
had been called a muggle  whatever that was  he was
had been close  very close  it was a few seconds
had been given special  new quills for the exams
had been pushed under the door  slotted through the
had been stuck together with what they recognized at
had been talking
had been trying to catch his eye   ron  however  was
had been working next to neville
had bought him  chocolate and raspberry with
had caught ron prodding dean s poster of west ham
had come bursting into the room  closely followed by
had decided that  as their secret weapon  harry
had died of boredom itself   no company except
had expected more marble  was surprised  they were
had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after
had four hundred and seventy two points   exactly
had gone  he flew in circles  lower and lower
had had it as long as he could remember  and the
had happened in the forest
had harry thought that things couldn t have been
had heard fred and george weasley complain about
had just said   at least hermione s on snape s tail
had more sense  as for you  mr  potter  i thought
had never seen anything so beautiful and sad  its
had never won so much as a point for gryffindor
had obviously tried to behead him  but not done it
had panicked and sent up the sparks
had passed  too  it was a shame  but as ron said  you
had powers i will never have
had sat on it  other shelves were full of books  they
had seen   then he jerked his head around to look
had seen in the forest  or because they didn t have
had swapped at school for a real air rifle  which was
had swapped his pointed wizard s hat for a flowered
had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair
had the dragon egg an  we could play cards fer it if i
had to do  like tapping the third brick on the left to
had to let that happen   said ron  looking shaken
had to struggle because the moment she had landed
had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back
hadn t  because professor mcgonagall s nostrils
hadn t he got his revenge  without even realizing he
hadn t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of
hagrid

hagrid
hagrid   he said quietly   i think you must have
hagrid   said dumbledore  sounding relieved   at
hagrid   said harry   that gringotts break in
hagrid   said harry  panting a bit as he ran to keep
hagrid   said harry  shocked to see hagrid shaking
hagrid   said harry loudly   give it two weeks and
hagrid   said harry loudly   there s an owl
hagrid   said hermione   how fast do norwegian
hagrid   said snape silkily   five points from
hagrid   tell yeh what  come with me an  see the
hagrid   what s that
hagrid  he bent his great  shaggy head over harry
hagrid  however  was on dean s side
hagrid  look  red sparks  the others are in trouble
hagrid  meanwhile  was counting bricks in the wall
hagrid  or we ll be found   professor mcgonagall
hagrid  raising his binoculars and peering skyward at
hagrid  s always wanted a dragon  he told me so the
hagrid  s big  hairy face appeared in the crack as he
hagrid  s chest swelled at these last words  harry and
hagrid  s coat seemed to be made of nothing but
hagrid  s darkened hut  trying to reason with him
hagrid  they waved and smiled at him  and the
hagrid  trying to imagine him flying
hagrid  who didn t wake up  the owl then fluttered
hagrid  you live in a wooden house   she said
hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkin s
hagrid asked
hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a
hagrid before they could fly off again
hagrid bit his lip
hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark
hagrid dropped the teapot
hagrid fiercely   yeh ve done wrong an  now yeh ve got
hagrid frowned at him
hagrid grinned at harry
hagrid grunted
hagrid gulped  but no words came out
hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate
hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take
hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag
hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn   you are
hagrid leaned across the table  behind the wild beard
hagrid looked as if he was about to explode
hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect
hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his
hagrid looked furious with himself
hagrid looked shocked
hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat
hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you
hagrid must have jumped  too  because there was a
hagrid proudly
hagrid puffing along behind her
hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again  tapped it
hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times
hagrid rolled up the note  gave it to the owl  which
hagrid s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads
hagrid s bringing him
hagrid s late  i suppose it was he who told you i d be
hagrid s with the other two during morning break
hagrid s yet
hagrid seemed to know where he was going  he was
hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them
hagrid shuffled into view  hiding something behind
hagrid shuffled off
hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke  as usual
hagrid suddenly looked horrified
hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty  spotted
hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly
hagrid was fuming  malfoy  it seemed  had sneaked
hagrid was positively beaming at him
hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house
hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily
hagrid was watching him sadly
hagrid watched him impatiently   unusually bright
hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and
hagrid wouldn t let harry buy a solid gold cauldron
hagrid yawned loudly  sat up  and stretched
hair
hair  and his robes whipped out behind him   and in
hair  and rather large front teeth
hair  beard  and mustache  underneath the picture
hair  freckles  and more children than they can
haircut  harry must have had more haircuts than the
hairs on the back of harry s neck prickled  maybe he
half an hour later  harry  who couldn t believe his
half inches  springy  go on  go on  try it out

harry  as they couldn t go through the mail slot they
harry  everyone says dumbledore s the only one
harry  from hagrid  inside was a roughly cut wooden
harry  harry  are you all right
harry  his broom was vibrating so hard  it was almost
harry  his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out
harry  meanwhile  still had questions to ask
harry  nasty  common name  if you ask me
harry  please relax  or madam pomfrey will have me
harry  relax  hermione  s right  the stone s safe as
harry  ron  and hermione didn t speak to each other
harry  ron  and hermione looked at one another
harry  ron  we ve got half an hour before lunch  we
harry  the idea of voldemort certainly scared them
harry  they had painted a large banner on one of the
harry  we ve got a week before we find out how badly
harry  where have you been   hermione squeaked
harry  who hadn t had any breakfast  leapt to his feet
harry  who was looking up  dittany  in one thousand
harry  who was starting to feel warm and sleepy
harry  who was still playing the flute  waved at ron to
harry  you need your strength   said seamus
harry a look that said quite plainly
harry added   we must ve been through hundreds of
harry and hermione didn t get a chance to answer
harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing
harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing
harry and hermione stayed quiet  watching ron
harry and hermione the harness they d rigged up  so
harry and hermione tried to calm ron down
harry and ron headed upstairs  smothering their
harry and ron jumped to their feet  they were half
harry and ron tried to look as though this story
harry and ron went back to the common room  harry
harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call
harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville
harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day
harry and seized his hand  tears in his eyes
harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon
harry and threw her arms around him
harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath
harry another of his sideways looks   if i was ter   er
harry as they pushed their way into the crowded
harry as though he d planned this  harry knew he
harry asked
harry asked
harry asked  trying to keep his voice calm
harry bolted to the door and looked out  even at a
harry borrowed ron s quill  scribbled yes  please  see
harry caught neville s eye and tried to tell him
harry caught sight of malfoy  crabbe  and goyle s
harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand
harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed
harry climbed over it and looked down through the
harry could have laughed out loud with relief  he was
harry could hear   nice to see you haven t been
harry could see ron s twin brothers catcalling
harry could see uncle vernon s shiny black shoes
harry couldn t believe anyone could be so interfering
harry couldn t eat  he had seen his parents and
harry couldn t sit down  he paced up and down in
harry couldn t speak  but hagrid understood
harry couldn t take it in  this couldn t be true  it
harry couldn t think of anything to say to comfort
harry counted out five little bronze coins  and the owl
harry did the best he could  trying to ignore the
harry didn t have a clue what was going on
harry didn t know what to say  everyone was looking
harry didn t know whether he was imagining it or not
harry didn t know whether to laugh or not
harry didn t miss a single one  and wood was
harry didn t move
harry didn t say anything
harry didn t sleep all night  he could hear neville
harry didn t think there was anything wrong with not
harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the
harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding
harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley
harry fell off  harry got slowly to his feet
harry felt  afterward  that he should have known it
harry felt as if devil s snare was rooting him to the
harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice  he
harry felt himself go red
harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a
harry felt restless  he wanted quidditch through the
harry felt terrible  in an hour s time he d be walking
harry felt the blood drain out of his face  wherever he
harry flushed  they turned to go outside  but snape
harry followed fred and george out of the locker
harry followed hagrid out onto the rock  the sky was
harry forced himself to keep looking straight into

harry glanced down at his broom  it was old and
harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair  with

harry got to his feet  he was shaking and out of
harry got toast  coconut  baked bean  strawberry
harry grabbed his broom
harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought  not
harry groaned
harry groped for the doorknob   between filch and
harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his
harry had a sudden idea
harry had almost forgotten that the exam results
harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the
harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in
harry had gone very white  as soon as he found his
harry had never been to london before  although
harry had never believed he would meet a boy he
harry had never even imagined such a strange and
harry had never in all his life had such a christmas
harry had never seen in his life  not wanting to miss
harry had only just raised his wand when they heard
harry had reached the shed  he leaned against the
harry had seen  the snake hadn t done anything
harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive
harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering
harry had the best morning he d had in a long time
harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick  hand
harry hadn t had a single letter since hagrid s note
harry handed the flute over  in the few seconds
harry hated it there  the whole house smelled of
harry he d be eleven in ten minutes  time  he lay and
harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole
harry heard the little girl s voice
harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at
harry his longest ever punishment  by the time he
harry hung back for a last word with ron and
harry ignored her  blood was pounding in his ears
harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand
harry jumped off his broom  a foot from the ground
harry jumped to his feet  caught quirrell by the arm
harry kept being woken by his old nightmare  except
harry kept to his room  with his new owl for
harry knew  somehow  what to do  he leaned forward
harry knew  when they wished him good luck
harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the
harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly
harry laughed  but he was one of the few who did
harry lay in his dark cupboard much later  wishing
harry lay there  lost for words  dumbledore hummed
harry leaned back quickly so they couldn t see him
harry leaned forward  quirrell was mumbling
harry leapt into the air  he d trodden on something
harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of
harry left  before snape could take any more points
harry left the locker room alone some time later  to
harry listened  a soft rustling and clinking seemed to
harry looked at ron  and was relieved to see by his
harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door
harry looked at the tiny bottle
harry looked back at hagrid  smiling  and saw that
harry looked down at his empty gold plate  he had
harry looked down at his feet  but they were gone  he
harry looked in the bowl again
harry looked into the fire  now he came to think
harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a
harry looked up at the giant  he meant to say thank
harry looked up into the fierce  wild  shadowy face
harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon
harry made his way down to the end of year feast
harry moved closer
harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently

harry nodded  but stopped quickly  because it made
harry nodded silently  he didn t have a clue what was
harry off ter live with muggles
harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a
harry on a stool next to him  slipped a long robe over
harry on the back   and i gave malfoy a black eye
harry opened it curiously  it was full of wizard
harry outta the air
harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an
harry picked it up and stared at it  his heart twanging
harry picked the shining  silvery cloth off the floor  it
harry picked up the top parcel  it was wrapped in

harry potted
harry potter
harry potter      it whispered
harry potter   chorused the twins
harry potter   said harry
harry potter   she squealed   look  mom  i can see

harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without
harry pressed on through the crowd until he found
harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didn t
harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning
harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter
harry pushed it open
harry pushed the door open
harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table
harry quickly looked down again as professor
harry realized his mouth was open and closed it
harry remembered about snape and the coming
harry remembered ron telling him on the train that
harry ripped open the letter first  which was lucky
harry s age had their noses pressed against a window
harry s bedspread
harry s broom jumped into his hand at once  but it
harry s broomstick had arrived
harry s direction
harry s ear  but harry shook his head  as they
harry s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them
harry s face
harry s feet  they had won  the chessmen parted and
harry s forehead
harry s hand   c can t t tell you how p pleased i am to
harry s heart did a somersault
harry s heart gave a horrible jolt  a test  in front of
harry s heart rose  if they were going to be working
harry s in front of him   and they had an owl
harry s is better than ours  though   said fred
harry s knee and drooled all over his robes
harry s last month with the dursleys wasn t fun
harry s legs  he stumbled backward
harry s mind was racing
harry s mouth fell open  the dishes in front of him
harry s own head  crying   harry  harry
harry s stomach lurched with nerves and ron  he
harry s victory faded from his mind as he watched
harry s wand  tapped the lock  and whispered
harry said   and the invisibility cloak   do you know
harry sank down next to the bowl of peas
harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the
harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read
harry sat down next to the window where  half
harry sat up and gasped  the glass front of the boa
harry saw  as though in slow motion  the ball rise up
harry saw it  in a great rush of excitement he dived
harry saw that hagrid looked very worried
harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at
harry scrambled to his feet  so happy he felt as
harry screwed up his courage
harry seriously doubted this  but thought it best not
harry shivered  he wasn t sure he liked mr
harry shook hands again and again   doris
harry shook his head
harry shook his head  he understood what he had to
harry shook his head and the boy sat down  he
harry shook his head violently to shut neville up  but
harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by
harry sighed and stretched out on the bed  yesterday
harry slid off his back
harry smiled weakly  yes  trying on the hat was a lot
harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils  a
harry spotted professor quirrell  too  the nervous
harry spotted the suit of armor
harry sprang toward the flame door  but voldemort
harry stared
harry stared
harry stared  then he looked quickly around to see if
harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the
harry stared at him  then he remembered   sir  the
harry stared at the back of firenze s head  which was
harry stepped aside  but with ron in front of the
harry stood quite still  both thinking the same thing
harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape
harry stood up
harry stretched out his hand at last to take the
harry struggled against the ropes binding him  but
harry suddenly jumped to his feet
harry suddenly realized that the tape measure  which
harry suddenly turned to ron
harry swallowed
harry swallowed   now what
harry swallowed and looked around him  he realized
harry swung round  the speaker was a plump
harry that dumbledore might not have been quite
harry the sudden  horrible feeling he d just plunged it
harry then did something that was both very brave
harry thought  then he said slowly   it shows us
harry thought she was probably right  but he wasn t
harry thought this was going a bit far  he had been to
harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron
harry time to run around it
harry to himself  it took almost ten minutes to get
harry told hagrid about snape s lesson  hagrid  like
harry told ron   come on
harry told the other two about snape  s sudden
harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest
harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket
harry took the wand  he felt a sudden warmth in his
harry took the wand and  feeling foolish  waved it
harry tried   but he had hardly raised the wand
harry tried  and tried  he had no idea what mr
harry tried to shut the door quietly  but
harry tried to take a step backward but his legs
harry tried to understand this but it made his head
harry tried to wave the owl out of the way  but it
harry turned around   and saw  quite clearly  what
harry turned over his card and read
harry turned the card back over and saw  to his
harry turned this news over in his mind  he was
harry turned to hermione
harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn t
harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up
harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other
harry walked round and round his new room
harry walked toward him
harry was almost glad that the exams weren t far
harry was faster than higgs   he could see the little
harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in
harry was glad school was over  but there was no
harry was going to ask ron if he d had any of the
harry was just helping himself to a baked potato
harry was on the point of unfolding his letter  which
harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn t have
harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid
harry was rubbing his forehead
harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose
harry was speeding toward the ground when the
harry was strongly reminded of dudley
harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking
harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn t
harry was wondering what a wizard did once he d
harry wasn t listening
harry wasn t sure he could explain  he d just had the
harry watched snape for a while  but snape didn t
harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as
harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as
harry went back to the kitchen  still staring at his
harry went back to the library  where hermione was
harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the
harry wished he had about eight more eyes  he
harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face
harry woke at five o clock the next morning and was
harry woke early the next morning  although he
harry woke with a start  his aunt rapped on the door
harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on

he and harry followed griphook toward one of the

he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll s
he blinked  it wasn t the snitch at all  it was a pair of
he blinked again  the smiling face of albus
he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on
he brought the umbrella swishing down through the
he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of
he can trust me  see
he carried everywhere  on the table
he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy
he caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot
he clapped his hands  in an instant  the green
he clapped his hands once  and the ropes binding
he cleared his throat
he climbed carefully along one of the branches
he could do without being taught   this was easy
he could see the high table properly now  at the end
he couldn t be sure the dursleys were asleep yet
he couldn t believe it  he d done it   the game was
he couldn t imagine where all the green light came
he couldn t move for fear
he couldn t stay here  he had to find his way back to

he dashed back across the road  hurried up to his
he did look very green  and when the cart stopped at
he did seem to realize he was being watched  because
he didn t catch it  he nearly swallowed it   flint was
he didn t say another word on the subject as they
he fell down  down  down and
he felt quirrell s arm wrenched from his grasp  knew
he felt the sorcerer s stone against his leg  dare he
he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that
he found ron and hermione playing chess  chess was
he found what he was looking for in his inside
he gasped  he stared at the back of the card  then he
he gasped  so did the people around him  about
he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight
he glared at them
he glared at them all as if to say   or else
he goes to smeltings
he grinned at harry s amazement  they stepped
he had a watch  he didn t know what time it was and
he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there
he had been down at hagrid s hut  helping him feed
he had been looking forward to learning to fly more
he had found in a history of magic  his school books
he had half a mind to ask wood to call time out
he had harry s knobbly knees   harry was looking at
he had just raised his wand when the compartment
he had leapt to his feet  in his anger he seemed to fill
he had never had any money for candy with the
he had never tasted anything so wonderful  but he
he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself
he had to start somewhere  setting the lamp down
he had to try it  now  he slipped out of bed and
he half expected voldemort to come bursting through
he handed harry a small club  a bit like a short
he has many demands on his time
he held out an enormous hand and shook harry s
he held out his hand to shake harry s  but harry
he hurried out from behind the bar  rushed toward
he ignored hermione  s hand
he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this
he is   said the first twin   aren t you   he added to
he is with me wherever i go   said quirrell quietly   i
he just said   harry s gone after him  hasn t he   and
he just wanted  em outta the way  all anyone knows
he laughed nervously   you ll be g getting all your
he led them to the very edge of the forest  holding his
he left
he let them in  struggling to keep a hold on the collar
he lies     he lies
he liked  as long as it took to find out who flamel
he ll be all right   said harry  trying to convince
he ll be all right   talk about showing slytherin
he looked closer at scabbers   no   i don t believe it
he looked in the mirror again  a woman standing
he looked so dangerous with half his mustache
he looked so handsome and grown up  harry didn t
he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still
he looked very pleased with himself  but hermione
he lowered himself through the hole until he was
he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked
he made sure peeves wasn t inside before shutting
he met vampires in the black forest  and there was a
he might have died and you wouldn t know the
he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the
he must be in the hospital wing  he was lying in a bed
he nearly had his leg ripped off once  he s not going to
he opened the crate  inside were four different sized
he owned from the cupboard to this room  he sat
he passed the sausages to harry  who was so hungry
he pointed at harry s forehead
he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket
he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings
he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to
he pulled open the next door  both of them hardly
he pushed his trolley around and stared at the
he put hagrid s flute to his lips and blew  it wasn t
he put harry s wand back into its box and wrapped it
he ran back down to the common room
he recognized the figure s prowling walk  snape
he remembers   cried dedalus diggle  looking
he rolled over and fell asleep again  and when he
he rose up in the air and floated there  squinting at
he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a
he s blocked by a second bludger   sent his way by
he s coming now
he s doing something   jinxing the broom   said
he s gone
he s gone

he s gone back to sleep
he s got lots o  rats an  some brandy fer the journey
he s heading for the third floor   harry said  but ron
he s just made that rule up   harry muttered angrily
he s just the build for a seeker  too   said wood  now
he s late  maybe he s chickened out   ron whispered
he s looking so nervous  that s professor snape  he
he s lost his marbles   ron muttered in harry s ear
he s not going   he said
he s not serious   he muttered to percy
he s still out there  bidin  his time  like  but i don
he s the gamekeeper   said harry  he was liking the
he s used to walking all over people  but that s no
he said  as a motorcycle overtook them
he sat back down  everybody clapped and cheered
he sat down  stared into the fire for a few seconds
he sat up and hagrid  s heavy coat fell off him  the
he saved his life
he saw his reflection  pale and scared looking at first
he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his
he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told
he shook his head and then  to harry s relief  spotted
he showed harry two identical balls  jet black and
he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his
he started to walk toward it  people jostled him on
he stepped forward  and the white queen pounced
he stepped in front of it
he stopped a passing guard  but didn t dare mention
he strode off in the direction of the staffroom
he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen
he swooped suddenly at them  they all ducked
he tapped the wall three times with the point of his
he then sank to the floor in a dead faint
he thinks this door is locked   harry whispered   i
he threw a dirty look at the dursleys
he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the
he took a deep breath  covered his face with his arms
he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the
he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry
he tried to edge to the left  to get in front of the glass
he tried to get past that three headed dog on
he turned and cantered back into the depths of the
he turned back to harry   you ll soon find out some
he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in
he turned to look at them all
he turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone
he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him
he walked forward and shook the centaur s hand
he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out
he wanted to keep his feet on the ground
he wanted to referee your next match  he was trying
he wanted to say something to defend himself  but
he wants payin  fer deliverin  the paper  look in the
he was about to be sick   he hit the field on all fours
he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon
he was at hogwarts with your father  didn t you
he was careful to walk a little way apart from the
he was gathering speed in a steep dive  racing the ball
he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of
he was in a very good mood  obviously he thought
he was looking over at harry as he spoke  crabbe and
he was playing quidditch
he was provoked  professor snape   said hagrid
he was quite right  of course  there was a big plastic
he was starting to feel definitely sick now  he
he was still so worried that he walked straight into
he was stranded in the middle of a station with a
he wasn t sure the snake could hear him   it must be
he waved his wand  but nothing happened  scabbers
he went  at times  he even wondered whether snape
he went to wood and offered to resign from the

he would blink  those silvery eyes were a bit creepy
he wouldn t take his eyes off you
head  and the game ended in complete confusion
head  it was as though his scar were on fire  half
head  the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat
head bowed in case of low hanging branches  but did
head felt as though it was about to split in two  he
head in a crisis    there s no wood   honestly
head through the branches
head torn off

heads down   yelled hagrid as the first boats reached
heaps of little bronze knuts
hear quirrell s terrible shrieks and voldemort s yells
hear running water  there must be a stream
hear the letters still streaming into the room
heard
heard
heard about slytherin  but he thought they looked
heard anythin  like it before
heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside
heard it  flocks of owls     shooting stars      well
heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you  he
heard quirrell s voice
heard ron say   hagrid  what are you doing in the
heard something that made their hearts stop   a
heard telling the other prefects   my brother  you
heard the name  potter   he decided he didn t dare
heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch

hearts as light as their hands  now that norbert was
heartstring  nine inches  nice and flexible  just take
heartstrings of dragons  no two ollivander wands are

heavy wooden door

hedwig kept bringing back dead mice  every night
heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone
held out his leg so harry could put the money into a
held people s arms behind their backs while dudley
held up his hand
held up his lamp to read the titles

hello   said the boy   hogwarts  too
hello  dear   she said   first time at hogwarts  ron s

her   if he d had a sister like that     but all the
her along  wouldn t you
her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  she
her eyes lingered for a moment on neville s cloak
her it was a dog  but i don t think she believes me   i
her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape
her to fang sometime  d yeh know  every time i go up
her wand  and said   wingardium leviosav

hermione   look   they re off  ouch
hermione   we haven t got time to send charlie
hermione  and hagrid took the left path while malfoy
hermione  and neville at the breakfast table  they
hermione  but this didn t soothe ron at all  on the
hermione  dancing up and down on her seat and
hermione  how many times in our lives are we going
hermione  however  had more on her mind than the
hermione  looking uncertainly after uncle vernon
hermione  of course  had the best grades of the first
hermione  rather bravely  harry and ron thought
hermione  s hand had shot into the air
hermione  the exams are ages away
hermione  the rest of the team wasn t too calm
hermione  who came back the day before term
hermione  you go there instead of that castle
hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat
hermione always liked to go through their exam
hermione and neville
hermione and neville were suffering  too  they didn t
hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto
hermione buried her face in her arms  harry strongly
hermione came in
hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak
hermione didn t seem as worried about the stone as
hermione didn t turn up for the next class and wasn t
hermione gasped  harry and ron wheeled round
hermione grabbed hagrid  s arm
hermione granger  by the way  who are you
hermione granger had come in
hermione granger was almost as nervous about
hermione granger was shrinking against the wall
hermione had become a bit more relaxed about
hermione had fought her way across to the stand
hermione had given him for christmas  he gave it to
hermione had got both her breath and her bad
hermione had managed to free herself before the
hermione had managed to get to her feet at last
hermione had now started making study schedules
hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that
hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in
hermione had sunk to the floor in fright  ron pulled
hermione hung her head  harry was speechless
hermione ignored him
hermione ignored him and spoke to harry
hermione jumped to her feet  she hadn t looked so
hermione left
hermione let out a great sigh and harry  amazed  saw
hermione looked convinced  but ron didn t
hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him
hermione looked very frightened  but she had a word
hermione marched away with her nose in the air
hermione moved closer together to block the fire from
hermione opened her mouth  perhaps to tell ron
hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end
hermione ran to turn him over  neville s jaws were
hermione read the paper several times  then she
hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown  flicked
hermione s eyes were wide
hermione s lip trembled  and she suddenly dashed at
hermione said   that s just the exams  i woke up last
hermione so she can keep him asleep
hermione stepped forward
hermione stood up  her crossed fingers in her mouth
hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it
hermione thoughtfully
hermione to complain that this was a whole night of
hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had
hermione tried her alohomora charm
hermione turned and walked straight through the
hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower
hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and
hermione was running toward them down the path
hermione was stomping up the stairs  looking
hermione was the last person to do anything against
hermione wasn t going to give up that easily  she
hermione whisper   it s bewitched to look like the sky
hermionel
hermionel  they said together
herself and pointing at them  at last  she clapped her
herself blown up and we got landed with you
hesitated  then made for him instead  lifting its club
hey  look   harry s got a weasley sweater  too
hey  mom  guess what  guess who we just met on
hey  potter  come down

hidden in
hiding a snigger  draco malfoy looked at him
hiding an illegal dragon in his hut
high  high up into the air  turned slowly over   and
high  petrified scream   and it was coming from the
high heeled  buckled boots  his blue eyes were light
high in the air  but it was still difficult to see what
high table
high to make out  and a magnificent marble staircase
high voice     oh professor flitwick  i m so worried  i
highway  dudley was sniffling in the back seat  his

him  if she was really there  he d touch her  their
him  it was hermione  harry caught a glimpse of her
him  of course  but it was a narrow corridor and if
him  out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering
him  she wrenched open doors and marched along
him a large brandy
him a second chance
him all these years
him and he caught a few words of what they were
him another rock cake  harry read the story again
him as though he d sunk into a hot bath
him away  but it had never happened  the dursleys
him away  they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop  it
him back to the dursleys  then handed him an
him by inches   the next second  harry had pulled
him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had
him he must transfer to slytherin at once  because it
him how to break his anti dark force spell
him i was gamekeeper here      he asked a bit about
him into a revolting old sweater of dudley s  brown
him off  ref  red card
him on the night they had met   some say he died
him over dinner all about mrs  next door s problems
him over with some friends of mine who are coming to
him the thumbs up  harry grinned back  and there
him the truth  that i was trying to stop you  and you
himself   right then   forward
himself   what do you reckon s next
himself  saw the black flames licking his body  but
himself heard over the babble
himself in time and hovered about a foot off the
himself on to his front legs so that harry could
himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa  and there
his aunt and uncle stared
his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything
his aunt was back outside the door
his back  he looked very out of place in his moleskin
his beard   hagrid  he d have found out somehow
his bed  or straying off to the quidditch field where
his broom
his broom gave a sudden  frightening lurch  for a
his broomstick and taken off  he hadn t been lying  he
his business from now on  he d had it with sneaking
his cart off down the platform in search of an empty
his chest   it s about the you know what in vault
his ears
his eyes
his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled
his eyes not used to the gloom  it felt as though he
his eyes off the key with the damaged wing   ron  you
his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a
his face   i m sure it is   try it on
his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache
his family  for the first time in his life
his father s     this had been his father s  he let the
his feet
his fingers  showing pointed fangs
his fist
his goblet on the table  it was a sickening sight
his hair was very untidy  it stuck up at the back  just
his hands   now they knew what had been in the
his hands clasped over his fat bottom  howling in
his hands on some of these  hagrid almost had to
his head  and began to pin it to the right length
his head  got back in the car  and off they went again
his head hurt  then he said   sir  there are some
his head when it screamed   slytherin
his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall
his heart sank faster than he d just dived  professor
his home number when he changed his mind  he put
his leg
his leg  while piers was swearing it had tried to
his legs  he saw only moonlight and shadows  it was a
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a
his life  he wouldn t be with dudley  dudley had been
his misery  he  ron  and hermione kept to
his most boring tie for work  and mrs  dursley
his mother had rubbed it
his name s scabbers and he s useless  he hardly ever
his neck prickled  the very dust and silence in here
his new video camera  crashed his remote control
his newspaper  the daily prophet harry had learned
his next present also contained candy   a large box
his nose
his office on the ninth floor  if he hadn t  he might
his own pile  which was a lot bigger than harry s
his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch
his pocket
his pocket  how many people wander around with
his second  who s yours
his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year
his stomach twisted as he imagined it  watching ron
his trip to diagon alley   how could he have been so
his trousers and sleeves were rolled up  and he was
his turban  what was going on  the turban fell away
his turban askew and terror on his face  everyone
his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of
his wand  and mr  ollivander bowed them from his
his whole attention to the mirror
hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all
history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and
hit them  dudley stopped pretending to cry at once
hmm   said a small voice in his ear   difficult  very
hmmm   said mr  ollivander  giving hagrid a

hogwarts was open to him in this cloak  excitement

holding his robes above his knees  one of his legs was
holding them inside the box
holding tight to his broomstick  trying to see through
holding up harry s sweater   she obviously makes
hole

it  there were four sandwiches inside  he pulled one
it  they heard him banging things with his smelting
it alone
it and give it a wave
it before the other team s seeker  because whichever
it before then if snape hadn t been muttering a
it bit me   he said  showing them his hand  which
it certainly seems so   said dumbledore   we have
it contains your new nimbus two thousand  but i
it didn t come     he kept on running     he opened his
it finally shouted   gryffindor   neville ran off still
it had  as for the stone  it has been destroyed
it had been harry s best christmas day ever  yet
it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on
it happened again  it was as though the broom was
it happened very suddenly  the hook nosed teacher
it into a corner of the room
it is   firenze agreed   unless all you need is to stay
it is  look down
it ll all be over at midnight on saturday   said

it looked as though harry had found out where the
it looked as though she might faint  she clutched her
it looked like an unused classroom  the dark shapes
it must have shrunk in the wash and  to his great
it must wake up the moment you stop playing   said
it only shows dead people  shame about not finding
it out of him  wizard indeed
it s   all   my   ruddy   fault   he sobbed  his
it s   it s true   faltered professor mcgonagall   after
it s a bit outta date  o  course  but it s all in here  keep
it s a kid   he s runnin  back up ter the school

it s dangerous  you should see the burns charlie s got
it s either really valuable or really dangerous   said
it s gettin  late and we ve got lots ter do tomorrow

it s nearly out   he ushered them inside
it s no wonder no one can stand her   he said to
it s not a stoat sandwich  is it   said harry
it s not any old broomstick   he said   it s a nimbus
it s not funny  and look after ron
it s not just my hand   he whispered   although that
it s not my fault   said wood   we ve just got to make
it s not poison   said harry anxiously
it s not that unusual  yeh get a lot o  funny folk in
it s not very good  is it  i ve tried a few simple spells
it s obvious   said ron   you can pretend to be
it s obvious  isn t it   said ron   we ve got to play our
it s okay   he called up to the light the size of a
it s on my ticket
it s our sport  wizard sport  it s like   like soccer in
it s sort of secret   he said  but he wished at once he
it s the best place for him   said dumbledore firmly
it s the full body bind   said hermione miserably
it s the girls  bathroom   harry gasped
it s tonight   said harry  once he was sure professor
it s too late to change the plan now   harry told
it s wing gar dium levi o sa  make the  gar  nice and
it safe for him  because they re friends and he knew
it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the
it seemed to be a handsome  leather covered book
it sneezed  a couple of sparks flew out of its snout
it sounded as though someone was threatening him
it started to rain  great drops beat on the roof of the
it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize
it took quite a while for them all to get off the
it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and
it waggled its long ears  making up its tiny mind  then
it was  sir  yes   said hagrid
it was a bit late to repair the damage  but harry
it was a dream   he told himself firmly   i dreamed a
it was a horrible sight  twelve feet tall  its skin was a
it was a magnificent mirror  as high as the ceiling
it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that
it was a sort of snuffling
it was a tiny  grubby looking pub  if hagrid hadn t
it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was
it was a while before any of them said anything
it was as harry dodged another bludger  which went
it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly
it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver
it was dinnertime  harry had just finished telling ron
it was enough  up in the air  harry was suddenly able
it was filch speaking to mrs  norris  horror struck
it was freezing in the boat  icy sea spray and rain
it was ginny weasley  ron s younger sister  but she
it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all
it was hermione who spoke first
it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body  he
it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look
it was motorcycles
it was not a mistake   said harry angrily   it had my
it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the
it was one of those rare occasions when the true story
it was only then that harry realized what was
it was only when he was back in bed that it struck
it was peeves  he caught sight of them and gave a
it was professor mcgonagall  carrying a large pile of
it was quidditch through the ages  harry showed him
it was quirrell
it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a
it was snape   ron was explaining   hermione and i
it was standing quite still  all six eyes staring at them
it was stifling hot inside  even though it was such a
it was sweltering hot  especially in the large
it was the best evening of harry s life  better than
it was the first time hermione had ever failed to
it was the grayish white of old porridge
it was the last thing they wanted to do  but what
it was the unicorn all right  and it was dead  harry
it was true that harry wasn t going back to privet
it was uncle vernon  still purple faced  still
it was very cold outside the car  uncle vernon was
it was very difficult  harry and seamus swished and
it was you
it wasn t going to be that simple  they hadn t gone
it wasn t his fault  professor
it wasn t mrs  norris  it was neville  he was curled up
it were waiting for something
it winked
it with  it was a nice feeling  sitting there with ron
it wrong  did you  that s another point you ve lost for
its burnished bronze doors  wearing a uniform of
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet
its song  it bowed to each of the four tables and then
ivo   harry hissed   i know it s here somewhere
ivo   shouted hermione granger   madam hooch told
james potter are   are   that they re   dead
jammed together so he couldn t speak  only his eyes
jaws but nothing worse than that  now  the last

lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides
lee was still commentating
left  middle fork  right  left  but it was impossible  the
left alone  ron looked still more awkward at this  but
left quirrell to die  he shows just as little mercy to his
leg  she can t take him   she jerked her head in
legged in the air  clutching the walking sticks
legs sprang apart and he got to his feet  trembling
lemon
lemon drops   as i say  even if you know who has
lent him  and they didn t trust him at all  he wasn t a
less time than the other two  because quidditch
lessened   he looked around wildly to see where
lessons that day  it kept wandering up to the
lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke  his classroom
lessons would be starting on thursday   and
let harry watch television and gave him a bit of
let me explain  the happiest man on earth would be
let me see it   demanded dudley
let me speak to him     face to face

library
library   dragon breeding for pleasure and profit
library  he hadn t paid attention to where he was
library  he said he d been looking for someone to
library  so he d never even got rude notes asking for
library  stepping carefully over the rope that
library books are not to be taken outside the
licking his ears  like hagrid  fang was clearly not as
licorice wands  and a number of other strange things
life  had written to him  who would  he had no
life  which will make the drinker immortal
light   said ron  but hermione told him to be quiet
light  a sound like a firecracker  a sharp squeal  and
lightning
lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry
like a giant elastic band  no one  ever  in his whole
like a slug
like a wounded dog
like an unpleasant lot
like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops  isn t
like corned beef
like dirty rags swimming in gray water
like everyone else s when i ve finished
like his  even a little old man who looked as though
like i said  yeh d be mad ter try an  rob it   said
like it
like that and disappeared off to that   that school
like that locked up in a school   said ron finally   if
like the look on malfoy s face at all
like this   he said irritably  he seized his left ear and
liked hardly any of the students
liked him a lot   great with animals
liked to disagree with dudley s gang
likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over
lily and james     i can t believe it     i didn t want to
line
line  put on the hat  which fell right down over her
lined the walls  bundles of feathers  strings of fangs
lips
liquid that he took a swig from before starting to
listen  harry  would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a
listen  we re going down the middle of the train
listening to dean and seamus falling asleep  neville
little about crabbe and goyle  but as the high table
little chat  and agreed it s all for the best
little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside
little railway tracks on the floor  griphook whistled
little teeth sunk deep into goyle  s knuckle   crabbe
little to take it even higher  and heard screams and
little tyke wants his money s worth  just like his
little whinging
little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to
live  white mice  up at the high table  dumbledore
live here   cried professor mcgonagall  jumping to her
lived
lived in the house  too
livid  on harry s forehead
living  on halloween ten years ago  you was just a
living room in time to catch the last report on the
living room where they were watching a quiz show on
load of old tosh   said uncle vernon  harry jumped
loaded into the dursleys  car  aunt petunia had
local public school  dudley thought this was very
lock it in
locked the thing in with her   harry reminded him
logic   a puzzle  a lot of the greatest wizards haven t
london  see  deep under the underground  yeh d die
london an  buy all yer stuff fer school
london in five minutes  time  hagrid  who didn t
long
long  slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where
long  thin package he had brought with them
long as dumbledore s around  anyway  we ve never

longbottom
longbottom  if brains were gold you d be poorer than
longbottom  nothing gives you the right to walk
longbottom s gran sent him
longingly out of the library window  it was the first
look     he murmured  holding out his arm to stop
look   hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to
look   said harry  throwing caution to the winds
look   said malfoy  darting forward and snatching
look  broomsticks  we ve got to catch the key to the
look  if you don t hurry up  hell already have the
look  look at them all     there are loads of them
look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them
look at him again
look at me   he said
look at the back   he was on to me by that time
look down at the ground falling away  saw him gasp
look excitedly at harry
look in it properly  go on  stand where i am
look like
look so angry  her lips were white  hopes of winning
look there   said hagrid   see that stuff shinin  on
looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it
looked as though he was about to cry  he strode out
looked back at him  just his head suspended in
looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say
looked behind him  sitting on one of the desks by the
looked burned  raw  red  and shiny
looked distinctly ruffled
looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror
looked like bodyguards
looked past quirrell s turban straight into harry s
looked quite painful
looked suddenly suspicious   yer not still lookin  fer
looked up  the figure had gone  a centaur was
looked up at ron and hermione
looked up at the high table again  hagrid was
looked younger  he had white blond hair and a
lookin  fer followers  got  em  too   some were afraid
looking
looking  and there  reflected behind him  were at least
looking at his fingers   they were blistering before his
looking at ron and harry  harry had never seen her
looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders
looking depressed
looking disapproving  he had clearly gotten halfway
looking for  none of them knew  he drove them into
looking forward to
looking frantically at the crowd
looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city  dudley
looking pleased with himself
looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was
looking terrified at the very sight of harry
looking tired but perfectly cheerful  indeed  by the
looks like a harp   said ron   snape must have left it
loomed suddenly out of the darkness
loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light
lose  and everything to gain  would commit such a
lost  he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a
lost his powers  too weak to carry on   cause
lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach
loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the
loud hissing filled the dungeon  neville had somehow
loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind
love
low  he d lost two points for gryffindor in his very
luck
luck  was sitting in the back of the dursleys  car with
lucky   shrieked hermione   look at you both

malfoy and fang  they walked for nearly half an
malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot  he
malfoy couldn t believe his eyes when he saw that
malfoy didn t move  he looked at hagrid furiously  but
malfoy face to face  he couldn t miss it
malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle
malfoy had seen the dragon
malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted   so did
malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle  sizing them up
malfoy now turned to hagrid
malfoy quickly

math and stuff
matter of fact   said harry   about what s guarding
maybe he just liked killin  by then  but he couldn t do
maybe he thought he could persuade  em     maybe
maybe hoped  that strangers in the street seemed to
maybe it was because they hadn t seen what harry
maybe she was taking him to dumbledore  he
maybe snape s found out how to get past him
maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it  harry
mcgonagall  who could spot trouble quicker than any
mcgonagall  with cold fury in her voice  harry looked
mcgonagall blew her nose in reply
mcgonagall explained
mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had
mcgonagall led the first years up here  so that they
mcgonagall meant     you really are a natural  i m
mcgonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front
mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house  but it
mcgonagall was out of earshot   snape s going
mcgonagall was running toward them  he got to his
mcguffin with the weather  going to be any more

merry christmas
merry christmas   said ron sleepily as harry
meself  number two  yeh know too much already  so i
met for several years  in fact  mrs  dursley pretended
met him when i traveled around the world  a foolish
midair  his body completely invisible  he pulled the
midair  malfoy looked stunned
middle  but they don t seem to have built it yet  do
middle and walked off
middle of the field waiting for the two teams  her
midnight on saturday   he said in a hoarse voice
midnight on saturday  they can meet you there and
might already have cracked from trying not to laugh
might as well get yer uniform   said hagrid  nodding
might be trouble gettin  hold of yeh  how much yeh
might be up to
might even now be playing fluffy to sleep
might get dangerous ideas
might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was
might have been harvey  or harold  there was no
might have thought so  yet somehow  even though
might have told us prefects  at least
mighta come up   said hagrid  frowning as he tried
miles behind everyone else  lots of people had come
mind
mind  i can t tell yeh everythin   it s a great myst ry
mind  swallowed  and then said   yes   yes  you re
mind by something else  as he sat in the usual
minerva mcgonagall
minister  o  course  but he d never leave hogwarts  so
ministry o  magic messin  things up as usual   hagrid
minute later with a pile of books in his arms and
minute quidditch practice wood was making them
minutes he stammered   what does it mean  they
minutes in front of the rest of the school  i suggest
minutes ready to leave  we re going away  just pack
mirror
mirror  and opened them again
mirror  but a whole crowd of people standing right
mirror  don t go back tonight
mirror  he couldn t see his family anymore  just ron
mirror  it was now reading the sign that said privet
mirror  the stone  and voldemort  ron and hermione
mirror  there was nothing to stop him from staying
mirror of erised shows us all
mirrors trick was that it reflected them  invisible or
miserable little shack you could imagine  one thing
miserable years  as long as he could remember  ever
miss granger
miss granger  five points will be taken from
miss it  i don t think i ve introduced myself  sir
missing that no one dared argue  ten minutes later
mistakes easily  when i failed to steal the stone from
mistletoe hung all around the walls  and no less than
mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no
mm   said hagrid  who was pulling on his huge
mmm   said harry  wishing he could say something a
moans from the slytherins
model is it
mom   geroff   he wriggled free
mom   he whispered   dad
mom didn t tell him she was a witch  til after they
mom s eyes
moment
moment   was that the snitch
moment  people meeting in secret all over the country
moment he spoke to it
moment hermione began to play  it fell back into its
moment later  dudley s best friend  piers polkiss
moment of his life  aunt petunia burst into tears and
moments  then  as though he had suddenly realized
monday   and you could usually count on dudley to
monday  this reminded harry of something  if it was
money  and a large owl
monstrous dog  a dog that filled the whole space
months  they had to keep bringing on substitutes so
mood until lunchtime  when he thought he d stretch
moon     nott         parkinson        then a pair of
moonlight from the high windows  at every turn harry
more  after all  this was the first night he hadn t been
more and more interesting now that they had
more and more nervous  whatever he told ron and
more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long
more n my job s worth ter tell yeh that
more of an effort if you re not family
more point
more quickly  he was going to smash right into that
more rats lurking among the sweets  or perhaps
more silence followed this little speech  harry and
more slowly
more students get thrown out  the better  he ll think
more study before yeh get ter that level
more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled
more time
more word
morning   said hagrid to a free goblin   we ve come
morning  askin  fer advice
morning  harry turned it off quickly and dressed
morning  he didn t see the owls swooping past in
morning to teach  leaving his body behind him  binns
morning traffic jam  he couldn t help noticing that
morning when harry went in for breakfast  it seemed
most important ball of the lot  it s very hard to catch
most of us reckon he s still out there somewhere but
most poisons  as for monkshood and wolfsbane  they
mostly  but they re good enough about turnin  up if
mother
mother  the room held no sign at all that another boy
mother had just taken out her handkerchief
motorcycle in it  he had a funny feeling he d had the
motorcycles dont fly
mount your brooms  please
mountain troll on your own
mountain trolls     he would never  ever forget tonight
mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the
mouse being trodden on
mouth  he felt particularly hungry after the
mouth  then he choked and said   alas  ear wax
mouthful of mud   when s he ever refereed a
mouthful of nails   if they can t deliver them they ll
move along  all of you
move along now   said a sharp voice   the sorting
moved at all  perhaps brooms  like horses  could tell
moved out of gringotts
movements  moaning and yawning  harry and ron
movements that almost unseated him
movies  every year  harry was left behind with mrs
moving toward them  they shrank into the shadows
mr  and mrs  dursley  of number four  privet drive
mr  dursley  come and look at this snake
mr  dursley always sat with his back to the window in
mr  dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy
mr  dursley sat frozen in his armchair  shooting stars
mr  dursley stood rooted to the spot  he had been
mr  dursley stopped dead  fear flooded him  he
mr  dursley was the director of a firm called
mr  h  potter
mr  h  potter
mr  ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare
mr  ollivander had come so close that he and harry
mr  ollivander moved closer to harry  harry wished
mr  ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry s
mrs  dursley  the potters knew very well what he and
mrs  dursley came into the living room carrying two
mrs  dursley had had a nice  normal day  she told
mrs  dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  mr
mrs  figg s cabbage smelling living room
mrs  norris   breathed ron  squinting through the
mrs  potter was mrs  dursley s sister  but they hadn t
mrs  weasley smiled down at them
much
much  they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed
much except hermione granger  who was whispering
much good
much homework on them that the easter holidays
much like going into the matter with this boy
much of a head start
much of her time craning over garden fences  spying
much people were gawking at them on the
much speed  then she fell back and waved
much time had passed  ten years ago  there had been
much time to fret about what snape or anyone else
much to be thankful for  would you care for a lemon
much to learn that even people like ron didn t have
much to think about as tea with hagrid  had hagrid
muggle families and they learn quick enough
muggle ones the dursleys usually bought  with their
muggle world  people just stay put in photos
muggles
muggles   someone tried to rob a high security
muggles from noticing us if we re keeping dragons in
mumbled  he stared through his binoculars   if i
murmured  tapping his way around the frame   trust
must be   said percy  frowning at dumbledore   it s
must be thick trees there  nobody spoke much
must get on   lots ter buy  come on  harry
must have done so  because a second later  he had
must have hurt  hit in the back of the head by a
must have made sense to dumbledore  though
must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my
must have walked straight past him  so desperate to
must not be named did great things   terrible  yes
must pay most dearly in their turn
must show that voldemort s coming back      bane
must ve been easy  once he d got hagrid drunk  i just
mustached  still looking furious at the nerve of harry
musty sheets  dudley snored but harry stayed awake
muttered  turning the page
muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve
muttered uncle vernon wildly
muttering about time wasters  harry was now trying
my dad doesn t believe it  he says malfoy s father
my dear friar  haven t we given peeves all the
my dear professor  i ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly
my dear professor  surely a sensible person like
my family s magic at all  it was ever such a surprise
my father s next door buying my books and mother s
my more brilliant ideas  and between you and me
my name is firenze   he added  as he lowered
my office  keep  em well oiled in case they re ever
my scar keeps hurting   it s happened before  but
my self finding it   which means i ll see where it s
myself against what is lurking in this forest  bane
mysterious  because they just didn t hold with such
mysterious things would soon be happening all over
mysterious to bother him  fell asleep almost as soon
mystery to harry  as dudley was very fat and hated
n nothing
nah   can t spell it  all right   voldemort   hagrid
nah  dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter
nah  i m all right  thanks  ron
name
name   said harry   i just never knew you shouldn t
name  dedalus diggle
name  everyone in our world knows
name  voldemort   professor mcgonagall flinched  but
name ever since hagrid had let it slip  because how
name for things  fear of a name increases fear of the
name to his boots was unwelcome  he was busy
nastier smile  he left without another word  harry
nasty  crunching noise  pinned it against the stone
nasty bit o  trouble with a hag   never been the same
nasty feeling they were being watched  he was very
nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs
near the brim opened wide like a mouth   and the
nearby  white faced and tight lipped   then harry felt
nearer  neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak
nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood
nearer home   said hagrid   so yeh haven t noticed
nearest him sat hagrid  who caught his eye and gave
nearest parcel   all right then
nearly   said harry
nearly headless  how can you be nearly headless
nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had
nearly there   harry panted as they reached the
neat  straight twigs and nimbus two thousand
neck   harry s scar was almost blinding him with
neck  small  watery blue eyes  and thick blond hair
neck  which came in very useful as she spent so
necks while they tried to remember how to make a
need an early capture of the snitch it s now  finish
needed      right  off we go  and don t think of running
needed a specially signed note from one of the
needed to sleep  he had to  he had his first quidditch
needed was a nice long search without madam pince
needle  by the end of the lesson  only hermione
needle sharp pain seared across harry s scar  his
needn t have bothered  i couldn t do anything with
neither   said hagrid grimly   right  follow me  but
neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides
neither knowledge or truth  men have wasted away
neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest
nervously  one of his eyes was twitching
net  had malfoy by the ear
never
never   in all my time at hogwarts
never   said hagrid irritably   try an  get a straight
never as often as this
never at hogwarts  we ve had a couple of broken
never been inside the stadium before  hundreds of
never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter
never forget you
never get such good results with another wizard s
never gone so long without winning  slytherins have
never had so many questions in his life
never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn t
never know
never mind   said harry quickly
never mind that   pig snout  pig snout   panted
never mind that  do you think he remembers what
never mind that now   said harry breathlessly   let s
never saw his face  he kept his hood up
never seen before  windows stacked with barrels of
never wonder where yer parents learned it all
neville     it s our fault he s here in the first place
neville   harry knew what it must have cost him to
neville   report him
neville   ron exploded   get away from that hole and
neville   she said   i m really  really sorry about this
neville  an  fang ll go the other  now  if any of us
neville  and fang took the right
neville  his face tear streaked  clutching his wrist
neville  indeed  looked as if he d never speak again
neville  the boy who kept losing his toad  sniffed once
neville  who looked as though he might cry
neville  you can look   ron said  neville had been
neville  you don t know what you re doing
neville  you stay with me an  hermione  harry  you go
neville clutched the sleeve of harry s robe and made a
neville had never been on a broomstick in his life
neville managed to have an extraordinary number of
neville s arms snapped to his sides  his legs sprang
neville s lips twitched in a weak smile as he
neville s remembrall i wouldn t be on the team
neville shook his head
neville stared at their guilty faces
neville the toadless boy  or hermione granger this
neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves
neville was trying to remember what he d forgotten
neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face
neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over
new  too
new students   said the fat friar  smiling around at
newspaper as he spoke   they say there s dragons
newspaper held in its beak
next  they had leapt back with howls of horror
next moment  harry found himself shaking hands
next morning at breakfast  everyone was rather quiet
next morning harry and ron thought that meeting
next second  quirrell came hurrying out of the
next to harry in the line  sat on the stool for almost a
next to him  who would suspect p p poor  st
next to the tall kid with the red hair
next week  folks  but i can promise a wet night

nice thirst to prove yourself  now that s interesting

no contact  what s the matter  never heard of a

no difference  his hair simply grew that way   all over
no more n four to a boat   hagrid called  pointing to
no more studying   ron sighed happily  stretching
no one  it was addressed to you by mistake   said
no one could wait for the holidays to start  while the
no one ever lived after he decided ter kill  em  no one
no one was there  or were they all invisible  too  was
no photographs of them in the house
no post on sundays   he reminded them cheerfully
no problems  were there
no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst
noble history and each has produced outstanding
nobody answered
nobody seemed about to explain anything  he said
nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a
nodding toward the front window  hagrid was
none of the lessons he d had so far had given him as
none of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past
none of you is to move while i take this boy to the
nonsense
nonsense  if i hear you ve come anywhere near here
nope   said ron   harry hasn t had much to do yet
norbert   and malfoy
norbert  who was now eating dead rats by the crate
norbert and the invisibility cloak  and they might as
norbert s going to be as long as your house  malfoy
norbert the norwegian
normal
normal man and at least five times as wide  he looked
norris  and harry felt he was pushing his luck
norris s christmas dinner
norris skulking near the top
nose  it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray
nostrils  hagrid hadn t been doing his gamekeeping
not
not a soul knows except me an  dumbledore   said
not a wizard  eh  never made things happen when
not allowed their own broomsticks
not allowed to go somewhere   the forest s full of
not answer
not answer harry s question  they made their way
not arguing  i hope  boys   he squeaked
not even when he d had to take a school report home
not exactly recent if he s six hundred and sixty five  is
not fast enough   said hagrid   it s not easy ter catch
not for nothing  though  was harry the youngest
not if i can help it   said hermione grimly   flitwick
not if you don t give us away  peeves  please
not knowin  about quidditch
not slytherin  eh   said the small voice   are you
not the stone  boy  you   the effort involved nearly
not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy s face
not to worry   she said   all you have to do is walk
not today  not now  you will know  one day     put it
not where i m going  i promise you   said harry
note
note clamped in its mouth  hagrid was the only one
note to ron to read
notes  hoping to come across one of the
notes before i remembered we d done that one
nothing   harry lied  they stopped to buy parchment
nothing   just black   there s no way of climbing
nothing   said harry
nothing   said harry  he felt very strange  who had
nothing   said ron eagerly
nothing  ha haaa  told you i wouldn t say nothing
nothing  he walked quickly down the corridor
nothing  neville  nothing   said harry  hurriedly
nothing  nothing
nothing  that s why it s such big news  they haven t
nothing a good beating wouldn t have cured   and as
nothing at all
nothing but dark fire   then he was on the other
nothing could have pleased him more than to see
nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful
nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet
nothing more or less than the deepest  most
nothing to what hagrid  s going to be in when someone
nothing very frightening in here  just a table with
notice something  shooting stars down in kent   i ll
noticed  too
noticed  very long fingers and feet  he bowed as they
noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing  as if it
noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban
noticed that harry s broom was behaving strangely it
noticed the first years
noticed the night before  and read
noticing
noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at
now   no one could say he was just a famous name
now  and did hagrid know something about snape
now  as i understand it  the house cup here needs
now  boy   any funny business  anything at all
now  don t ask me anymore   said hagrid gruffly
now  don t forget  it s locomotor mortis   hermione
now  don t forget that nice wrist movement we ve
now  form a line   professor mcgonagall told the first
now  i want a nice fair game  all of you   she said

now what   said aunt petunia  looking furiously at
now what   said ron
now what am i going to do   she asked shrilly
now what do we do   harry whispered
number four on the dursleys  front door  it crept into
number nine over one platform and a big plastic
number ten over the one next to it  and in the middle
numbers  the goblin wrinkled his nose  harry
o  course i can t   he said   number one  i don  know
o  the teachers did enchantments     professor sprout
o clock for your first training session
o clock in the morning  explain yourselves
o witchcraft and wizardry

oak
oak  sixteen inches  rather bendy  wasn t it
object was that it was about two inches long  they
obviously  you ve just done so   dumbledore smiled
obviously been a mistake and he d better get back on
obviously guarding something
obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary
odd  because he usually gives us a reason why we re
odd watch  it had twelve hands but no numbers
oddball mixed up
oddly today  viewers as far apart as kent  yorkshire
of       everyone knows that  it s hard to stop
of   kill him  kill him   and other voices  maybe in
of a great black lake  perched atop a high mountain
of a powerful magical substance  mr  potter  we use
of all his homework  but harry could hardly believe it
of all of them  however  this mirror will give us
of all people
of all the cats she d ever owned
of an enormous black boarhound
of answering questions about batty old wizards who d
of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of
of candles that were floating in midair over four long
of chocolate frogs from hermione
of comfort
of course   said quirrell coolly   why do you think
of course he has   said ron  wheeling around   i m
of course i didn t  you re invisible   forgive old
of course not   said harry  eager to see more magic
of course not   said hermione   everything we need
of course not   said hermione briskly   how do you
of course there are   said ron   common welsh
of desks and chairs were piled against the walls  and
of finding more than treasure there
of frog spawn  turning teacups into rats  i was the
of garlic as well  so that quirrell was protected
of gryffindor students
of her arms  but she didn t pick them up
of his neck
of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a
of hunger tryin  ter get out  even if yeh did manage ter
of loop the loops to let off his feelings  now he was
of magic and flew off for london at once
of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions
of narrow rows
of nowhere as he pulled off harry s invisibility cloak
of people called potter who had a son called harry
of potion making   he began  he spoke in barely more
of privet drive  but there wasn t a map in sight  what
of recent developments in wizardry   said ron   he s
of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had
of sight  harry didn t think quirrell had even noticed
of suits of armor  they could hear filch getting
of the cart   what s the difference between a
of the chasers  beaters  bludgers  and quaffle to get
of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor  they
of the first years  on top of the stool she put a pointed
of the forest  hagrid greeted them  looking flushed
of the front door in a sleeping bag  clearly making
of the ghosts  the students all hated him  and it was
of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy
of the line
of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up
of the stands opposite them  he had his eyes fixed on
of the street  he could just see the bundle of blankets
of the students  and harry heard a familiar voice
of the twins
of the weasley twins
of their brooms  but it was no good   every time they
of them apart and said   she always forgets i don t
of trees  however  when firenze suddenly stopped
of what awaits the sin of greed
of what they were saying
of wood up its nose  and harry s wand had still been
of year feast tomorrow  the points are all in and
off  now  it ll be worse for you if you do

quidditch trials will be held in the second week of
quiet life with the dursleys
quietly as possible  they crept along the next corridor
quirrell
quirrell  however  must have been braver than they d
quirrell  in his absurd turban  was talking to a
quirrell  mr  ollivander     but i don t know anything
quirrell  standing quite still as though he was
quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and
quirrell cursed again
quirrell cursed under his breath
quirrell does  so if i look in the mirror  i should see
quirrell had gone  and saw him hunched in pain
quirrell moved close behind him  harry breathed in
quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse
quirrell rolled off him  his face blistering  too  and
quirrell rounded on harry
quirrell s face
quirrell s face
quirrell s head  there was a face  the most terrible
quirrell s head looked strangely small without it
quirrell s turban  which kept talking to him  telling
quirrell s voice trailed away  harry was remembering
quirrell said snape
quirrell shivered suddenly   he does not forgive
quirrell smiled  his face wasn t twitching at all
quirrell snapped his fingers  ropes sprang out of thin
quirrell was walking backward at him  so that
quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts
quite apart from wanting to win  harry found that he
quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight

ready  are you

real wizards  the most you and malfoy ll be able to do

red hair  each of them was pushing a trunk like
red stone  it winked and put the stone back in its
redder and redder in the face as he called for more
reflected in those misty eyes
reflections did not fade and he looked and looked
reflections were so close together  but he felt only air
relief  harry wasn t punished
remains of the food faded from the plates  leaving
remarkably like dudley  except that it wasn t blond
remember  can t you see how much better off he ll be
remember  firenze  we are sworn not to set

ribbon flew out of it  which rose high above the tables
ribs  caught by surprise  harry fell hard on the
rice pudding

right  it s time  good luck  all of you
right  now
right  of course  but how is the boy getting here
right at harry   unicorn blood was dribbling down its
right behind his reflection was smiling at him and
right direction  but peeves the poltergeist was worth
right down to the floor
right places  and when harry told them what was
right then   said hagrid   now  listen carefully
right up to the ceiling  for some reason  the back of
roaming the school three nights in a row   if filch had
roaring along like maniacs  the young hoodlums
roaring fire there  it filled the whole damp hut with
roaring fires  the drafty corridors had become icy and
roast and boiled potatoes  platters of chipolatas
robe shop  he was looking at harry with a lot more
robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and
robes  and harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge
robes  slytherin would be playing in green
robes quickly to hide his leg  harry gulped
rock after hagrid s lamp  coming out at last onto
rocks and pebbles
roll call  and like flitwick  he paused at harry s name
ron
ron
ron
ron   can i have a frog  i might get agrippa   thanks
ron   ron leapt forward  but before he d so much as
ron   said hermione suddenly   harry
ron  and hermione would press their ears to the door
ron  at the next table  wasn t having much more
ron  but she was such a bossy know it all that they
ron  full of turkey and cake and with nothing
ron  he suspected he wouldn t have lost so badly if
ron  he threw his wand back into his trunk   stupid
ron  ron  where are you  the game s over  harry s
ron  still not daring to take his eyes from the game
ron  though  was staring transfixed at his image
ron  told harry not to worry about it  that snape
ron  you ve got something on your nose
ron also started teaching harry wizard chess  this
ron and hermione  meanwhile  had found a place in
ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology
ron and hermione in the distance  jumping up and
ron and hermione joined neville  seamus  and dean
ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid
ron and said   if anything happens to me  don t
ron beamed at hermione
ron behind him  and they walked out of the chamber
ron bit his lip
ron casually  getting started at last on his cold pie
ron couldn t get worked up  it was too hot
ron couldn t resist it
ron couldn t see what was exciting about a game with
ron didn t answer  snape had just awarded
ron dived  hermione rocketed upward  the key
ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs
ron dropped his wand  hermione granger  telling a

ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows  hermione
ron followed right away  he landed  sprawled next to
ron gasped
ron gave a slight cough  which might have been
ron glared at her as she left  harry peered out of the
ron grabbed the binoculars  snape was in the middle
ron grunted in his sleep  should harry wake him
ron had already had a big argument with dean
ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room
ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped
ron just as interesting as ron found him
ron let go of the front of malfoy s robes
ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at
ron picked up a green bean  looked at it carefully
ron proudly   listen  you ve got to be up for the end
ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat
ron read
ron round   that took a while   and we were
ron s ears went pink  he seemed to think he d said
ron s eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs
ron s nerves were already stretched to the breaking
ron snapped  before malfoy knew what was
ron so  all about having to wear dudley s old clothes
ron stared after her  his mouth open
ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the
ron started to direct the black pieces  they moved
ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous
ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to
ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to
ron was fascinated by the fifty pence
ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class
ron was so amazed  so impressed  he just sat and
ron went purple in the face  he looked like a radish
ron went speeding in the direction that harry was
ron were delighted when she told malfoy he d been
ron wouldn t have minded  but she kept nagging
ronald weasley  who has always been overshadowed
ronan
ronan  anythin  unusual
ronan didn t answer immediately  he stared
ronan pawed the ground nervously   i m sure firenze
room
room
room
room  a cozy  round room full of squashy armchairs
room  a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace
room  harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in
room  how he had managed to climb through the
room  on the opposite side of the chamber was a
room  some sparkling with tiny icicles  some glittering
room and  hoping his knees weren t going to give way
rotted cabbages  barrels of slimy stuff stood on the
round and round  howling  and when scabbers finally
round ball  wings fluttering  darting up ahead   he
round here   said hermione in a warm  flattering
rubbish   said hagrid   why should he

rubbish   said hagrid again   snape s a hogwarts
rubeus  rubeus hagrid  how nice to see you again

rules   came an angry voice from just behind them
rumbling with hunger  dudley s snores were drowned
rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  but
rumors  harry told them everything  quirrell  the
run   harry yelled  and the four of them sprinted
running around looking for it  snape  who already
running around underneath him holding a mattress
running to keep up with the train until it gathered too
rustling of leaves around them
s ppose yeh ve worked that out an  all  beats me how

same question  neville was snoring loudly  but harry
sandwiches  which they refused

sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a
sat down as though this was as normal as talking on
sat down next to him   i need to concern  he caught
sat on to wait  harry felt strangely as though he had
sat quickly down on a toilet  clutching his heart
sausage  they re not bad cold   an  i wouldn  say no
sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking
savaging the coat
save yourself  and you will have but a half life  a
saved the stone  it s gone  he can t use it  have a
saw  looked pale under his freckles  they crammed
saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms  a lion
saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars  he heard
saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had

scowling  malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall
scowling at her   would you mind leaving while we
scrambled into the common room and collapsed
scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe
scrambled through it   neville needed a leg up
scrambling up the grassy slope   that what hagrid
scratch himself  charlie weasley couldn t have done
screamed
screamed   for he had seen not only himself in the
screamed  seize him   and the next second  harry
screamed but stayed on her square   the white
screams of people watching   he stretched out his

scroll and took the sorting hat away

seamus whispered

seeker   he said   but first years never   you must
seeker  which could happen to anyone  i m sure  so a
seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra
seeker in a century  he had a knack for spotting
seeker next  then he d realized that nobody found
seeker s job to catch it  you ve got to weave in and out
seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players
seem to be slowing down
seemed not to notice   it all gets so confusing if we
seemed the easiest thing in the world after that  not
seemed to be full of white smoke
seemed to cheer ron up
seemed to come from quirrell himself

session  wood gave the team a bit of bad news  he d
set  the white mice had disappeared and harry had a
set  which he d put his foot through when his favorite
set brass scales
set glass or crystal phials
set gryffindors apart
set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a
set off
set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field  he d
seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a
seven hundred and thirteen
seven players on each side  three of them are called
seven years  but would they be allowed to  with such
seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twenty nine
several chipped mugs  and a bottle of some amber
several feet of snow  the lake froze solid and the
several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with
several years
severus   quirrell laughed  and it wasn t his usual
severus does seem the type  doesn t he  so useful to
shade of green  it looked as if norbert s fangs were
shadow and vapor     i have form only when i can
shadows  a hooded figure came crawling across the
shadows  they had almost reached the portrait hole
shake  em off     shake  em off   he would mutter
shaken his hand in the street the other day and then
shaking  harry moved three spaces to the left
shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at
shaking their heads  they went off to lunch
shan t say nothing if you don t say please   said
shape of the markings the cat had had around its
shaped packages  with the snowy owl asleep in its
share     not being truly alive  he cannot be killed  he
share another s body       but there have always been
sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second
sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick
sharply
she and the others existed only in the mirror
she d be able to tell them  but they couldn t risk
she d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats  and
she didn t even notice malfoy and ron rolling around
she didn t have a sister  because her sister and her
she didn t seem quite as fond of them as before  she
she doesn t know about the troll
she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion
she felt they deserved what they d got
she had a bossy sort of voice  lots of bushy brown
she had fer a sister
she hadn t spoken to either of them since the day
she heard us  come on
she held up a letter so they could read the green ink
she kissed percy on the cheek and he left  then she
she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall  she
she left the chamber  harry swallowed
she might not have needed saving if we hadn t
she must ve noticed she s got no friends
she opened the door and poked her head inside
she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons  he
she pulled the door wide  the entrance hall was so
she pushed the book toward them  and harry and
she raised her wand
she said all this very fast
she said quickly   and we ll buy you another two
she sat down  ron looked taken aback
she stood up  glaring at them
she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went
she straightened his many candy boxes   i can  can t
she struck ron hard across the head with her stone
she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it
she threw a sharp  sideways glance at dumbledore
she turned to the rest of the class
she was a very pretty woman  she had dark red hair
she was going to use on him
she was in here herself  buying her first wand  ten
she was still flat against the wall  her mouth open
sheets
sheets scabbers had ruined  it said potter for
shelf for an interesting looking book  a large black
shelling peas into a large bowl
shelves  taking down boxes
shelves  the happier he seemed to become
shhh   hissed professor mcgonagall   you ll wake the
shhhh   hagrid looked around quickly to see if
shhhh   said hagrid again   listen   come an  see
shimmering fumes  the delicate power of liquids that
shiny  with a mahogany handle  it had a long tail of
shock  and her glasses flashed furiously      how dare
shock when one of them glided suddenly through a
shocked  he stopped crying   i ve met him and i m
shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant
shoo   said mr  dursley loudly
shook  professor mcgonagall blinked furiously  and
shop
shop
shop as they stepped inside  it was a tiny place
shopping  a plump woman outside an apothecary
shops
shops  the things outside them  the people doing their
shortcuts didn t make the work much easier
shortly  she bent down and gathered up the fallen
shot toward malfoy like a javelin  malfoy only just got
should be in the library
should be kept  well  secret  but the news that he was
should call filch  i should  if something s a creeping
should i break it
should tell filch  i should   said peeves in a sanity
shoulder   i know     i know      he said heavily
shoulder  but it heard the yell and paused again
shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back
shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left
shouldn t be too difficult   i think the cloak s big
shouldn t have hit him at the quidditch match  that s
shouldn ta lost me temper   he said ruefully   but it
shouted   gryffindor
showed no mercy  soon there was a huddle of limp
showers of owls tonight  jim
showing people in and out of these  hagrid and harry
shown the red card and you re out of the game
shuddered   don  make me say it again  anyway  this
shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet  ron pointed   at
shut   said hagrid
shut up   harry whispered
shut up   said ron
shut up   said ron again  he was almost as tall as
shut up  both of you   said harry sharply   i heard
shut up  i m trying to remember how to kill it   said
shut up  malfoy   snapped parvati patil
shut up  peeves   please   you ll get us thrown
shut up  you two   said wood   this is the best team
sick
side  in the last chamber
side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom
sides  and a few even forced through the small
sigh of the wind  every cracking twig  what was going
sighed  as evening after evening they struggled
sight
sight
sight
sight of a flash of gold  but it was just a reflection
sight of harry s face   what s the matter with you
sight of him
sign of sleepiness  it was sitting as still as a statue
signed up at once  he didn t feel sorry for himself at
silence   yelled uncle vernon  and a couple of
silence  the dog growled and twitched  but the
silent
silent
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole
silently  he mustn t wake the dursleys  he stole
silently wherever he sent them  harry s knees were
silver  like the handle
silver beard
silver of his hair and beard  which were both long
silver to celebrate slytherin  s winning the house cup
similar
simply melted away
simply rolled over on the ground  and neville s hadn t
simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long
since  scared of the students  scared of his own
since he d been a baby and his parents had died in
since last night at least
single day  piers  dennis  malcolm  and gordon were
sinister desire to be a quidditch referee
sir
sir   professor dumbledore  can i ask you
sir   said harry   i ve been thinking     sir   even if
sir nicholas looked extremely miffed  as if their little
sister being what she was  oh  she got a letter just
sit down   he snapped at hermione   for your
sit on the stool to be sorted   she said   abbott
sitting astride it  he was almost twice as tall as a
sitting back down on the sofa  which this time sagged
sitting back down on the wall   really  dumbledore
sitting on the windowsill  staring down at the lights of
six hundred and fifty eight
skin  not without suffering terrible pain   his only
skinnier than he really was because all he had to
skinny for his age  he looked even smaller and
skipping when he told us
sky  was a vast castle with many turrets and towers
skyward
slammed on the next street  nor when two owls
slammed them down on the table
sleep
sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no
sleeping pattern   the newscaster allowed himself a
sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the
slid back their door and said   anything off the cart
sliding  led the way to the broken down house
slightly   the towering white chessmen had no faces
slightly smaller than the red quaffle  harry noticed
slip sideways off the broom and
slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the
slipped under filch s outstretched arm and streaked
slippers  as still as a statue
slipping and stumbling  they followed hagrid down
slithering over dead leaves nearby  it sounded like a
slouched slowly into the room
slowly  the room emptied as people drifted off to bed
slumped against the table  and gasped   troll   in
slytherin  four hundred and seventy  two
slytherin  not slytherin
slytherin  wandering around in the middle of the
slytherin captain  marcus flint  a fifth year  harry
slytherin in possession   flint with the quaffle
slytherin in possession   lee jordan was saying
slytherin lose the house cup  everywhere harry
slytherin table  harry could see draco malfoy banging
slytherin won  of course   you missed the last
slytherins have taken the quaffle  slytherin captain
small  empty chamber off the hall  they crowded in
small  just matches into needles and that sort of
small  walled courtyard  where there was nothing but
small leather pouch tied to it  then he flew off
small noises
small pile of packages at the foot of his bed
small son  too  but they had never even seen him
smarmy that we found in our first week  see you
smash
smatter of fact
smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the
smell of sizzling sausage  nobody said a thing while
smelled strongly of garlic  which everyone said was to
smelting stick  uncle vernon straightened up
smeltings  piers polkiss was going there too  harry
smile
smile  he caught harry s eye and harry knew at once
smiles off their faces if we win
smiling
smiling   it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up
smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the
smooth  damp grass right in the shadow of the castle
smooth  flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds
smudged nose  harry nervously tried to flatten his
snape
snape
snape  he crossed the corridor and disappeared from
snape  it wasn t even voldemort
snape  like flitwick  started the class by taking the
snape  s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his
snape  s lips curled into a sneer
snape  taking a step toward him
snape  whose laugh became high and cold   there
snape  with quirrell bringing up the rear  quirrell
snape and filch were inside  alone  snape was
snape bent over the troll  professor mcgonagall was
snape didn t dislike harry   he hated him
snape enter the forest at a run  he followed
snape gave harry a swift  piercing look  harry looked
snape hearing what they were up to
snape helped protect the stone  he s not about ter
snape if he could have it
snape made them all nervous  breathing down their
snape needs to break through
snape off for a while  but i m no match for him
snape s   said harry   what do we have to do
snape s done it  then   said ron   if quirrell s told
snape s face when harry had seen his leg wasn t easy
snape s head of slytherin house  they say he always
snape s refereeing   he spluttered through a
snape s refereeing this time  and he ll be looking for
snape s trying to force quirrell to help him get it  he
snape spat bitterly on the ground
snape wants the stone for voldemort     and
snape was standing there
snape was still ignoring hermione s quivering hand
snape was threatening you
snape was trying to save me
snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning  he
snape wasn t blinking at all  i saw him
snape would never know what had happened
snapped   didn t you see what it was standing on
snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on
snarled
sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at
sneered
sniff around  my sweet  they might be lurking in a
sniggered behind their hands  snape finished calling
snitch
snitch   wood had said   we don t want you attacked
snitch  he tried to catch it  but his arms were too
snout  but it won t help you now  the fat lady s gone
snowballs so that they followed quirrell around
snowy  mr  paws  and tufty again
snuffbox was  but taken away if it had whiskers
so   after that obvious and disgusting bit of
so   back again  harry
so   said dumbledore  slipping off the desk to sit on
so   said ron  but he looked a bit uncomfortable
so   snapped mrs  dursley
so   yeh wanted to ask me somethin
so all aboard
so all i ve got to wait for now is snape to steal the
so harry set off into the heart of the forest with
so he knew  the feeling suddenly surged back into
so i suppose you think that s a reward for breaking
so if you seek beneath our floors
so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set
so it has been for ages past  so it is now
so light a fire   harry choked
so loud was the noise that erupted from the
so me  harry  an  hermione ll go one way an  draco
so now they had something else to worry about  what
so proud  mr  potter  i m just so proud
so put me on  don t be afraid l
so short he was almost bald except for his bangs
so sorry  your bloodiness  mr  baron  sir   he said
so teach us things worth knowing
so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on
so that s where you know who
so the stone s gone   said ron finally   flamel s just
so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off
so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under
so this is dumbledore   said harry
so try me on and i will tell you
so we ve just got to try on the hat   ron whispered to
so we were right  it is the sorcerer s stone  and
so what   harry shouted   don t you understand
so what happened to you two   said harry
so what if they can t see you  what if they walk into
so what is quidditch
so what on earth s hagrid up to   said hermione
so where shall i put you
so who sent these
so why did he just try and kill harry   cried
so you mean the stone s only safe as long as quirrell
so you must know loads of magic already
sobbing into hagrid s jacket for the last five minutes
sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours
soccer team  trying to make the players move
socks  he found a pair under his bed and  after
soft landing  you can jump
softly   thirteen and a half inches  yew  powerful
solutions to their problems  nah  we re best left
some clothes  no arguments
some just wanted a bit o  his power   cause he was
some money on the ground   said malfoy
some of dudley s old things gray for you  it ll look just
some of the feeling started coming back to his legs
some of the first to come back to our side after you
some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles
some presents
some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse
some sacrifices  i make my move and she ll take me
some say he died  codswallop  in my opinion  dunno
some sort of test  i think  fred said it hurts a lot  but
some that led somewhere different on a friday  some
somebody  dudley s favorite punching bag was harry
somebody s been in the library   restricted section
somebody would discover it  they didn t think they
someone else in his family   in this case  his
someone far less welcome turned up  malfoy  flanked
someone had poked ron in the back of the head  it
someone had tried to rob gringotts  but ron hadn t
someone just outside the door
someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and
someone knocked into harry as they hurried past
someone s going to try and steal the stone  i ve got to
someone speak   and it wasn t malfoy
someone standing outside the great hall might well
someone to complain to  aunt petunia shredded the
someone was after it  that s why he wanted the stone
someone was lookin  through the gap in the curtains
somethin  about you finished him  harry  there was
somethin  goin  on that night he hadn t counted on
something
something
something
something
something     yes  that would be it  the traffic moved
something  and gryffindor really can t afford to lose
something  but he didn t  so she went on   a fine
something  snape interrupted him
something  we had no idea
something  you know that night you won norbert
something about quirrell s  hocus pocus    i reckon
something about the smile lurking on malfoy s face
something as important as this
something bright white was gleaming on the ground
something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney
something definitely moved
something desperate
something else  for the first time in his life  a high
something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the
something gold was glinting just above him  the
something had been nagging at the back of his mind
something held him back   his father s cloak   he
something important  when he tried to explain this
something into something else  of course  it s
something out of the grass   it s that stupid thing
something really extraordinary had to be inside this
something snape could never forgive
something that malfoy had been quick to notice  of
something that sounded like  mimblewimble   hagrid
something that will bring you back to full strength
something the boy didn t   he works at hogwarts
something to her  he cleared his throat nervously   er
something to them  but thought better of it
something useful
something very nasty that couldn t understand them
something very painful was going on in harry s mind
something you have to say is more important than
something you wanted to hide   except perhaps
sometimes   he said   i find it hard to follow my
sometimes  harry noticed  the hat shouted out the
sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of
sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could
somewhere
somewhere  perhaps looking for another body to
somewhere  we ll see you later
somewhere close by  there were still spots of unicorn
somewhere else  because they didn t see him
son goin  ter hogwarts  yer mad  his name s been
song   cried dumbledore  harry noticed that the other
sorcerer s stone  i bet he asked dumbledore to keep
sorcerer s stone  she had started drawing up study
sorry   barked hagrid  turning to stare at the
sorry   harry said quickly
sorry   he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled
sorry   he said   but have you seen a toad at all
sorry   he said   but it s that sad   knew yer mum
sorry   i mean  the night my parents died
sorry   said harry   but what s curious
sorry  george  dear
sorry  professor
sorting hat chose you for gryffindor  didn t it  and
sound  where there should have been a back to
sound made him freeze where he stood  a bush on
sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his
sounding half exasperated  half admiring   but you re
sounding quite delighted   you did do the thing
speak   got the lot here   another young man being
speak to him at all  half terrified  half furious  they
speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king s
speaking quietly so that no one else would hear
special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he
sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive
speed  the air became colder and colder as they
speed things up a bit  would yeh mind not
speedy   we ll have to get him a decent broom

spiders fell from the ceiling  he took a few deep
spindly chair
spinning dangerously past his head  that it happened
spiral staircase  and into the gryffindor common
splendid place  it was lit by thousands and thousands
split open  the baby dragon flopped onto the table  it
split second  he thought he was going to fall  he
spoil your special day   she cried  flinging her arms
spoils everything   he shot harry a nasty grin through
spoke   young sirius black lent it to me  i ve got him
spoke  though quirrell wasn t moving his lips
spore
sport  harry hunting
spot  he couldn t move a muscle  petrified  he
spotted harry  and hurried over
sprinting across the grounds toward the forest  didn t
sprout say    it likes the dark and the damp
squashy package of sausages  a poker  a teapot
squeal of delight
squeeze him to death  but worst of all  for harry at
squinting about for some sign of the snitch  this was
stabbing pains in his forehead  which had been
stage   nothin  i can t handle
staircase up to the third floor  peeves was bobbing
stairs
stairs  as they stepped into the corridor  filch s face
stairs was full of them  and that was where he slept
stalagmite and a stalactite
stalagmite s got an  m  in it   said hagrid   an  don
stammering his thanks  sounding just like professor
stand back   said griphook importantly  he stroked
stand back   wood warned harry  he bent down and
stand back  harry
stand between platforms nine and ten
standing behind quirrell  it was the mirror of erised
standing over him  not ronan or bane  this one
standing rather closer together than they would
standing there  grinning at harry and pointing at two
stands up to snape   said hermione in alarm
stared as he reached professor dumbledore s chair
stared hungrily into it
stared wildly at harry
staring  harry wished they wouldn t  because he was
staring at him from the other end of the street  for
staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling
staring at the door  someone was outside  knocking
staring at the glistening brown coils
staring at the three of them   miss granger  you
staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the
staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until
start  harry s new resolution not to interfere in
started  but soon realized they weren t going to be
started  they were back to skimming through books
started  took a different view of things  she was torn
started moaning that his feet were dead with cold
started running for the exits
started to get annoyed  as though harry was being
starting to get a prickle of fear every time you know
starving   said harry  taking a large bite out of a
stay in the same room  while aunt petunia and uncle
stay there   she said  and she sprinted up the stairs
stayed gray and fast asleep
steal it
steal one somehow
steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these
step  now  firs  years follow me
stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak
stick all the way down the hall  then he shouted
stick out your right hand over your broom   called
sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree
still  facedown
still and silent
still couldn t take his eyes off the giant  finally  as
still famous   said ron  grinning at him
still get really good marks and everyone thinks they re
still got yer letter  harry   he asked as he counted
still had a black mark on his nose
still howling twenty minutes later  but it made no
still in possession
still rising higher and higher  and started to drift
still there  it was staring down privet drive as though

stop it from going down   and i ll try and catch it
stop moving   hermione ordered them   i know what

stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper
stopped dead in his tracks
stopped talking to watch
stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly
storm forecast for tonight   said uncle vernon
storm to deliver mail  harry privately agreed  though
story  harry left the library  he  ron  and hermione
story and believed it  too
story when every kid in our world knows his name
straight at the barrier between platforms nine and
straight back to the gryffindor common room  where
straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle   twelve
strained his memory during long hours in his
strange how nearsighted being invisible can make
stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in
street toward number four  where he sat down on the
string  peppermint humbugs  teabags     finally  harry
strong  sweet tea while he apologized over and over
struck mr  dursley that this was probably some silly
stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out
students  some hanging out of the window to talk to
students  warning them not to use magic over the
students had binoculars  the seats might be raised
students may also bring an owl or a cat or a toad
students out of bed   peeves bellowed
students out of bed down the charms
students out of bed in one night  i ve never heard of
study on the first floor  where they sat and waited
studying a month ago  i don t know what s gotten into
studying dragons  we could send norbert to him
studying lost  but she didn t say a word  like harry
stuff from the kitchens
stuff upstairs  now
stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf  he ran
stunned and horrified if he d just had the body bind
stunned face that he hadn t learned all the course

stupid as he was mean  might be thrown out  but he
stupid new fashion  he drummed his fingers on the

swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky
swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of
switch
swooped overhead  in fact  it was nearly midnight
swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren t
sworn a low  hissing voice said   brazil  here i come
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end
table  snatched the remembrall out of his hand
table where the teachers were sitting  professor
tables  where the rest of the students were sitting

that  yeh ve done yer bit  i ll take over from here
that a couple of them weren t young at all  why  that
that almost broke their teeth  but harry and ron
that car crash  he couldn t remember being in the car
that cars new  he s not sitting in it alone
that didn t look as if it belonged there  something that

that does look good   said the ghost in the ruff sadly
that evening  dudley paraded around the living room
that evening when he got back from work  uncle
that girl is  and rather attractive  too
that had happened so far
that harry and dudley were still in the room  dudley
that harry potter s in this compartment  so it s you  is
that he didn t want to tell harry
that he was getting the loudest cheer yet  percy the
that he was nowhere near the third floor   who do
that he was on fire  a sudden yelp told her she had
that he was smiling
that hedwig was shut safely in her cage  and then
that his head just brushed the ceiling  he bent down
that is  he would look into it and see himself exactly
that is because it is a monstrous thing  to slay a
that it was now worse than ever because there was a
that lay smoothly on his thick  fat head  aunt petunia
that leaves you free to checkmate the king  harry
that looked like a bill  and   a letter for harry
that might help him hang on to his broomstick later
that oaf  well  think again  boy   it s into the forest
that one   he called to the others   that big one

that s you done  my dear   and harry  not sorry for
that s your problem   said ron   we ve got to go
that s your problem  isn t it   said filch  his voice
that seems to be in order
that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the
that she was crying  smiling  but crying at the same
that she was smiling  the very last thing he felt like
that shouldn  be
that snape  s feelings toward him hadn t changed one
that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner   how
that the nation s owls have been behaving very
that there s still witches an  wizards up an  down the
that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps
that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn t
that third night he found his way more quickly than
that this boy   this boy    knows nothin  abou
that was empty except for peeves  who was busy
that was far easier than i thought it would be   said
that was lying on the table under the tea cozy  it was
that wasn  no werewolf an  it wasn  no unicorn
that will do   he said  and the tape measure
that you should be destined for this wand when its
that your first time on a broomstick  potter
the afternoon s events certainly seemed to have
the air of summer coming
the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with
the anger faded from hagrid s face  he looked
the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the
the arrivals board  he had ten minutes left to get on
the baby banged its tail on the wall  making the
the back garden   anyway  you can t tame dragons
the back of his hand
the barbers looking as though he hadn t been at all
the bat to stop it from breaking his nose  and sent it
the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its
the best game in the world     and he was off
the big one   said fred weasley
the black knight nodded  ron turned to the other
the bludgers   i mean  they re like a pair of human
the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again
the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there  with
the book was screaming  harry snapped it shut  but
the bottles  harry looked over her shoulder to read it
the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms  and the
the boy who lived
the brick he had touched quivered   it wriggled   in
the bush   we were wondering if you could tell us
the card  it showed a man s face  he wore half moon
the card  you collect them  don t you
the castle  clearly not wanting to be seen  it walked
the castle feeling saturday couldn t come quickly
the cat  it stared back  as mr  dursley drove around
the cat didn t move  it just gave him a stern look
the cat watching him  if anyone looked out of their
the ceiling for a few days  i ve got the chains still in
the ceiling with books as large as paving stones
the centaur didn t answer  he had astonishingly blue
the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through
the chessmen seemed to have been listening  because
the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the
the class
the class everyone had really been looking forward to
the cliff  they all bent their heads and the little boats
the cloak didn t stop him from being solid
the club flew suddenly out of the troll s hand  rose
the cold wall and wiping his forehead  neville was
the common room  and climbed through the portrait
the common room  nobody bothered them  none of
the common room was packed and noisy  everyone
the confusion  of course  the golden snitch had
the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his
the country  mr  dursley hummed as he picked out
the countryside now flying past the window was
the crowd  his heart skipped  he felt braver
the crowd thronging the corridor
the cupboard under the stairs
the curtains were closed  hagrid called  who is it
the dark forces  a guide to self protection by quentin
the dark leaves
the dark side  i m going through that trapdoor
the dark wizard grindelwald in       for the
the darkness   this was his big chance to beat
the dearest ambition of many to give mrs  norris a
the din was deafening  those who could add up while
the distant music stopped  there was a loud bark
the dog again
the door   we re done for  this is the end
the door  and lock it
the door at any moment  yet the days crept by  and
the door behind them  then he told them what he d
the door gently with one of his long fingers and it
the door of the compartment slid open and the
the door swung open at once  a tall  black haired
the door was hit with such force that it swung clean
the dungeons   thought you ought to know
the dungeons  where their breath rose in a mist
the dursleys   but did snape expect him to remember
the dursleys  house had four bedrooms  one for
the dursleys got into bed  mrs  dursley fell asleep
the dursleys had everything they wanted  but they
the dursleys had never exactly starved harry  but
the dursleys often spoke about harry like this  as
the edge of the clearing quivered      then  out of the
the egg in the fire   cause their mothers breathe on
the egg was lying on the table  there were deep
the end of a passage to the left  something huge was
the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn t
the envelope was thick and heavy  made of yellowish
the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned
the face for weeks
the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around
the family
the famous harry potter  their hero of two quidditch
the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and
the fire  but he seemed to be looking for a reason to
the fire  underneath the kettle  was a huge  black egg
the firs  years  professor mcgonagall   said hagrid
the first few carriages were already packed with
the first morning  when about a hundred owls had
the first potions lesson  he knew he d been wrong
the floor   harry suggested   i wasn t looking at its
the floor with harry   you  like hundreds before you
the following morning  notes were delivered to harry
the following week dragged by  wednesday night
the forbidden forest
the forest   he repeated  and he didn t sound quite
the forest was black and silent  a little way into it
the four houses are called gryffindor  hufflepuff
the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell s
the furor over the points they d lost  he half expected
the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too
the gap in his mothers arms
the ghost   i don t need to  of course  but one does
the ghost began stiffly  but sandy haired seamus
the ghosts didn t help  either  it was always a nasty
the giant chuckled
the giant chuckled darkly
the giant sat back down on the sofa  which sagged
the giant squeezed his way into the hut  stooping so
the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with
the giant was working  but as he slid the first six fat
the glass as though he was hoping to fall right
the glass ball high into the air and streaked back
the glass smartly with his knuckles  but the snake
the goal posts and then sped up and down the field
the goblin looked at it closely
the goblin read the letter carefully
the gold ones are galleons   he explained
the golden plates  as it had at the start of term
the greenhouse roof  and he still didn t have his room
the grin that was spreading over his face    they don t
the ground  neville hesitated  then clambered over the
the ground  silvery stuff  that s unicorn blood
the grounds for their first flying lesson  it was a clear
the gryffindor common room was very noisy that
the gryffindor first years followed percy through the
the gryffindor table  he was so relieved to have been
the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any
the hall looked spectacular  festoons of holly and
the hangings   get off scabbers  he s chewing my
the harry potter
the hat  he stared at it  too  for a few seconds  there
the hat over his eyes for ages  until professor
the hat took a long time to decide with neville  when
the head  next moment  thirty or forty letters came
the hem of snape  s robes
the high voice spoke again
the hog s head   that s one o  the pubs down in the
the hoops to score   harry recited   so   that s sort of
the house
the house quidditch teams and told long  boastful
the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering
the hut  hermione wouldn t hear of it
the inside exploded a rear admiral s hat and several
the inside was horrible  it smelled strongly of
the invisibility cloak  malfoy doesn t know about
the journey from platform
the keeper   i m keeper for gryffindor  i have to fly
the keeper of the keys
the keeper of the reptile house was in shock
the key s in the lock   harry muttered   we could
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan
the kitchen with his mother  dudley looked a lot like
the lake  they were boarding the hogwarts express
the last shop was narrow and shabby  peeling gold
the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over
the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry
the lead  he d done it  he d shown snape
the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely
the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh
the leaves
the letter back inside its envelope
the letters  he got out a hammer and nails and
the letters from no one
the letters into pieces before his eyes
the library   said hagrid  following them out of the
the library  wandering around the dark passageways
the library was pitch black and very eerie  harry lit a
the light of adventure was kindling again in ron s
the lighted dial of dudley s watch  which was
the little bronze ones
the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles
the lock clicked and the door swung open   they
the man with two faces
the middle  a small hole appeared   it grew wider
the middle of a forest  got out  looked around  shook
the midnight duel
the ministry of magic  potter
the minutes dragged by  their ears seemed sharper
the mirror of erised
the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow
the moment  he thought  is to find the stone before
the moment it didn t look in the mood  in fact  it was
the moment they sat down in her first class
the moon was bright  but clouds scudding across it
the morning  however  the first thing he saw was a
the moth eaten sofa  she and uncle vernon went off
the muggle world   everyone follows quidditch
the names and looked up at the class  his eyes were
the names of different stars and the movements of the
the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge
the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  he
the neck from behind  after a minute of confused
the next chamber was so dark they couldn t see
the next morning dawned very bright and cold  the
the next morning in defense against the dark arts
the next night  they tried retracing harry s route from
the next second  dudley was dancing on the spot with
the night s surprises weren t over
the nimbus two thousand at last
the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he
the oldest boy came striding into sight  he had
the one we ve all been waiting for   said george
the only one you know who was afraid of  didn t dare
the only thing hermione ever lost at  something harry
the opposite direction for a while
the other side of the clearing  ronan and bane came
the other slytherins joined in
the other two agreed with him  anything to get rid of
the other two followed him  they tugged and heaved
the other two stared at him  he was pale and his eyes
the others laughed
the out of bounds corridor on the third floor  he
the owl out into the storm  then he came back and
the package from harry and felt it
the pain had gone as quickly as it had come  harder
the pain in harry s head was so bad he fell to his
the paint flashed different colors
the place
the plant  in a matter of seconds  the two boys felt it
the plant from curling around his neck
the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils
the players could get some sleep
the portraits along the corridors whispered and
the potions master
the potters  that s right  that s what i heard
the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared
the prewetts   an  you was only a baby  an  you
the problem was  strange things often happened
the quaffle  okay  got that  so what are they for   he
the quidditch field  bundled up in a long moleskin
the quidditch season had begun  on saturday  harry
the quills  thought he d make you look good if he got
the rat was still snoozing on ron s lap
the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job
the receiver back down and stroked his mustache
the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up
the repaired alarm clock rang at six o clock the next
the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another
the rest of the team landed next to george to
the restricted section was right at the back of the
the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins
the room  neville appeared from behind an armchair
the room went deadly quiet       for pure nerve and
the room went very still  the slytherins  smiles faded
the round bottle at the end  and shuddered
the rules  and here she was  pretending she had  to
the rumors that are flying around  you know what
the same  just as no two unicorns  dragons  or
the same as bein  in the crowd  no sign of the snitch
the same as slytherin  they had tied for the house
the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at
the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed
the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy
the same time   i want you all back here in five
the school better than anyone  except perhaps the
the school brooms  saying that some of them started
the second room and made up a bed for dudley on
the seven players  describing famous games he d been
the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the
the shriek went on and on  one high  unbroken
the sight gave him the creeps
the sky had turned light before they stopped talking
the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the
the slytherins were already there  and so were twenty
the slytherins were cheering  no one seemed to have
the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the
the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and
the snake nodded vigorously
the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes  slowly
the snow still hadn t melted the next morning
the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under
the sorcerer s stone  after all
the sorcerer s stone  of course   the elixir of life
the sorta creatures i look after     so i told him     an  i
the sorting ceremony will take place in a few
the sorting hat
the sorting hat can t see
the speck that was harry
the spectators were high enough to see what was
the spell didn t work  i ll show you  look
the standard book of spells  grade    by miranda
the stands  his broom had started to roll over and
the stands erupted  it had to be a record  no one
the stands next to neville  who couldn t understand
the stars overhead seemed to quiver  percy could be
the start of term banquet will begin shortly  but
the station  know who he is
the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower
the stone  but rest assured  no one can possibly steal
the stone  it must have been easy to find out how the
the stone apart from fluffy
the stone or fluffy  that ll take a lot of explaining
the stone s gone  vol   i mean  you know who
the storm raged more and more ferociously as the
the street  the dursleys knew that the potters had a
the street  trying to look at everything at once  the
the students  the ghosts shone misty silver  mainly to
the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons
the sunny grounds   i needn t have learned about the
the sunshine
the table on the right cheered and clapped as
the table second from the left clapped this time
the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch
the teams marched onto the field  something that ron
the telephone
the term  anyone interested in playing for their house
the thinnest  most ragged blanket
the thought didn t cheer him up at all
the three headed dog had been an excellent
the three of them
the three of them put their heads together to read the
the time he got back  the mail had arrived  right into
the train
the train
the train  dumbledore s silver hair was the only thing
the train began to move  harry saw the boys  mother
the train pulled out of the station  harry wanted to
the train rounded the corner  houses flashed past the
the train slowed right down and finally stopped
the train that left at eleven o clock  but the guard said
the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it
the trees blocked their view
the trees were so thick he couldn t see where snape
the troll if you follow my orders  stay close behind
the troll stopped a few feet from hermione  it
the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside
the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a
the trophy room
the truth   dumbledore sighed   it is a beautiful and
the truth  what did you just see
the twelve uses of dragon s blood or practicing wand
the twinkling light that usually shone from
the twins already and his nose was still pink where
the twins were back
the two boys gawked at him  and harry felt himself
the vanashig glass
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
the very least   but at first he thought it was empty
the very thought
the walking sticks on neville s head  they heard him
the wall
the wall
the way hagrid goes on about it  you d think it was a
the weasley twins  friend  lee jordan  was doing the
the weasley twins yelled   we got potter  we got
the weasleys  who ve got no money   you should be
the weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding
the west ham fan up in the top row  as a surprise for
the what   said harry and ron
the whirl of fists that was neville  crabbe  and goyle
the whistling wind could be heard
the white king took off his crown and threw it at
the white pieces  harry  ron and hermione shivered
the white queen turned her blank face toward him
the whole crowd gasped  harry s broom had given a
the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished
the whole hut  the dursleys were cowering against
the whole school  but he didn t know any magic yet
the whole school s out there   said fred weasley
the whole school s talking about it   said ron   what
the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright
the window
the window
the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way  but she
the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of
their backs on the white pieces and walked off the
their brooms
their brooms  that s why you have two beaters on
their chance
their daring  nerve  and chivalry
their discussion  they hadn t realized how loudly they
their faces  after what seemed like hours they
their faces  nearly headless nick flipped his head
their families  some fighting over seats  harry pushed
their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four
their first real shock came when their other knight
their friend  there are some things you can t share
their hot cauldrons
their lesson  the three of them dropped their trowels
their living room  which was almost exactly the same
their minds
their mother suddenly became very stern
their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined
their reach       dreading going to school with that
their table
their teacher  madam hooch  arrived  she had short
their very last exam was history of magic  one hour
their way to platforms nine and ten  harry walked
their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats
them
them
them
them
them
them
them   about to be sorted  i suppose
them   he added nastily  and he turned and started
them  but the more they strained against it  the
them  cups  shields  plates  and statues winked silver
them  either  you hang around with riffraff like the
them  harry and dudley promptly had a furious but
them  it grew steadily louder as they looked up and
them  spray from the high waves splattered the walls
them  they climbed in   hagrid with some difficulty
them  to make them forget
them  were there really shops that sold spell books
them  you    see  you just wait  all right  we ll take
them a glass ball the size of a large marble  which
them all there
them angrily as he passed  he didn t know why  but
them as should be sorry  i knew yeh weren t gettin
them copy   how will you learn     but by asking her
them in exactly the right place  and doors that weren t
them into the hall  slamming the kitchen door behind
them leave  saying ron needed sleep
them like an angry goose
them looking at each other  they all said  thanks
them out of london  now they were speeding past
them outside
them over the branches of the new tree
them pull their robes up over their noses  eyes
them say   the new nimbus two thousand   fastest
them sparkling clean as before  a moment later the
them to do the same
them were all quite happy to join in dudley s favorite
them were laughing  harry s mouth went rather dry
themselves  working late into the night  trying to
themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life  my
then  about a week before the exams were due to
then  during one particularly wet and muddy practice
then  one breakfast time  hedwig brought harry
then a noise in the next room made them jump
then a pain like he d never felt before pierced his
then a small voice came out of the shadows
then a sudden movement ahead of them made them
then dropped his gaze
then everybody started talking loudly at once  he
then harry knew  quirrell couldn t touch his bare
then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up
then he turned slowly on the spot
then kill him  fool  and be done   screeched
then malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher
then she changed her desk into a pig and back again
then she met that potter at school and they left and
then she suddenly smiled
then something happened that made him jump about
then there was a great scraping of chairs and the
then tomorrow  tuesday  was harry s eleventh
then well be able ter   get behind that tree
then who does  sir  i
there
there
there
there   no  there   with bright blue wings   the
there  but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit
there  d been a mistake  how could they suddenly
there  look
there  the people hurrying by didn t glance at it  their
there  unfortunately  while everyone else was
there are a few things we wanted to ask you  as a
there are all kinds of courage   said dumbledore
there are other things guarding the stone apart from
there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and
there had been a small fortune belonging to him
there have been many reports of the sorcerer s stone
there he is  mom  there he is  look
there he was  reflected in it  white and scared
there is  i ve heard   i ve learned all our course books
there s a ministry of magic   harry asked  before he
there s a note   said ron suddenly   a note fell out of
there s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat
there s all sorts of things in there   werewolves  i
there s another one   mr  h  potter  the smallest
there s light ahead   i can see something moving

there s not a single witch or wizard who went bad
there s nothin  that lives in the forest that ll hurt yeh
there s nothing hidden in your head
there s only enough there for one of us   he said
there s something strange about you  probably
there s still fluffy  though   said hermione
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
there seemed to be something wrong with his voice
there they were  his mother and father beamed at the
there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon
there was a hitch  by the next morning  ron s bitten
there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next
there was a knock on the door of their compartment
there was a loud  oooooh
there was a note pinned to it
there was a pause  then
there was a pop  and a little man with wicked  dark
there was a sudden rummaging for quills and
there was a tap on the dark window
there was a very embarrassed pause  then  none of
there was already someone there   but it wasn t
there was an uproar  it took several purple
there was an upturned wastepaper basket   but
there was no alternative
there was no answer  he knocked again  nothing
there was no doubt about it  hagrid definitely didn t
there was no reason for them to come near him and
there was no signature  harry stared at the note  ron
there was nothing else for it
there was only one room inside  hams and pheasants
there was silence inside the hut  only the sea and
there was suddenly a loud tapping noise
there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from
there wasn t one  in the end the guard strode away
there were a hundred and forty two staircases at
there were empty brandy bottles and chicken
there were only two rooms
there weren t many people left now
these
these   said fred weasley sadly   hagrid was there to
these birds     they can t be here just for decoration
these dreams
these tables were laid with glittering golden plates
they
they
they   he was starting to feel that nothing would
they  but i know i ll be in slytherin  all our family
they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched
they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on
they both looked up  it was hermione granger
they bought harry s school books in a shop called
they came much nearer they d knock right into him
they came to a sudden halt
they can t be far  we ll catch them
they clambered up the stone steps onto the street
they could hear footsteps  filch running as fast as he
they could suspend norbert between them  they all
they couldn t afford to waste any more time  snape
they d been too polite to refuse  harry thought that
they d heard footsteps  because a second later
they d left  uncle vernon had taken harry aside
they d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower
they didn  keep their gold in the house  boy  nah
they didn t give  he had to keep quirrell from giving
they didn t meet anyone else until they reached the
they didn t stop to eat or drink all day  by nightfall
they didn t tell him much  their peeling  faded gold
they drove  and they drove  even aunt petunia didn t
they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the
they edged toward the open door  mouths dry
they fell backward   harry slammed the door shut
they flitted along corridors striped with bars of
they followed professor mcgonagall across the
they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead
they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a
they frog marched percy from the room  his arms
they had a good time eating the every flavor beans
they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel
they had been looking for two weeks  after all  but as
they had indeed been searching books for flamel s
they had just passed a bend in the path when
they had left the shop  he said   hagrid  what s
they had practical exams as well  professor flitwick
they had reached a snowy white building that
they had reached another door
they had reached the portrait of the fat lady
they had reached the station  there was a train to
they had the dormitory to themselves and the
they had to speak about him  they called him  the
they had to study the night skies through their
they had wrenched their way through the boarded up
they hadn t even reached the end of the corridor
they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in
they heard a distant shout
they heard him crashing away through the
they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters
they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the
they hurried out of the chamber and didn t speak at
they inched closer
they just looked at him  smiling  and slowly  harry
they knew someone was there who shouldn t be
they know things     jus  don  let on much
they landed quickly  and harry ran to the door  the
they left the hall quickly  wanting to unwrap the
they ll all forget this in a few weeks  fred and george
they ll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy
they looked around  as if hoping to see a sign
they looked at each other
they looked at one another
they looked at the dragon  it had grown three times
they made him uneasy  this bunch were whispering
they marched down the sloping lawns toward a
they marched off across the dark grounds  neville
they marched on up the corridor  wood looking
they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn t
they oughta change the rules  flint coulda knocked
they passed different groups of people hurrying in
they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the
they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after
they pulled on their bathrobes  picked up their
they pushed the door open  harry dropped the cloak
they re dead   said harry shortly  he didn t feel
they re here   said aunt petunia frantically   and a
they re in here somewhere   they heard him mutter
they re not birds   harry said suddenly   they re
they re not completely stupid  they were bound to
they re saying that when he couldn t kill harry potter
they re the only family he has left now
they reached a fork in the earth path  and harry
they reached king s cross at half past ten  uncle
they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest
they reached the end of the passageway and saw
they seemed to know he hadn t received his first
they set off again   the bloody baron s the only one
they settled down in the boat  harry still staring at
they slipped back down the spiral staircase  their
they snapped me wand in half an  everything  but
they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor
they stared at each other  seeming to have forgotten
they stared at him
they started throwing themselves at him
they stepped over the threshold  and immediately a
they stopped and so did he  just near enough to hear
they stuff people s heads down the toilet the first day
they throw off the cloak  glad to be able to breathe
they ve left  anyway
they ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one
they walked down the road  he didn t even notice how
they walked in silence  their eyes on the ground
they walked more slowly  ears straining for the
they walked on through the dense  dark trees  harry
they walked past a mossy tree stump  harry could
they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded
they watched the birds soaring overhead  glittering
they went to bed exhausted  their throats sore  but
they were a witch and wizard  if that s what you
they were all very impressed and couldn t wait to get
they were and carved from what looked like black
they were going even deeper now and gathering
they were looking straight into the eyes of a
they were or where they were going   they ripped
they were passing through a particularly dense patch
they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard
they were standing with their backs to it  getting
they weren t in a room  as he had supposed  they
they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time
thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to
thief  you have been warned  beware
thin package carried by six large screech owls  harry
thing
thing  we might have ter put it out of its misery
thing it would be if  on the very day you know who
thing itself
thing you saved me from  anyway
things couldn t have been worse
things didn t improve for the gryffindors as the
things from you  mr  potter      after all  he who
things he liked to eat on one table  roast beef  roast
things i want to know the truth about
things like parking meters and saying loudly   see
things other people didn t  after a minute s weaving
things to stop him       but how in the name of heaven
think   let me think
think  finally he said   now  don t be offended or
think about as he climbed back into bed  the dog was
think about how he was going to look on his first day
think about it  the invisibility cloak and whoever had
think he could bear it
think i got question fourteen b wrong
think my name s funny  do you  no need to ask who
think of dark tunnels
think they took anything  that s what s odd   course
think well be okay   get off neville   for neville had
think you d get to the stone without us  i d better go
think you should be breaking any more rules  and
thinking     no  he was being stupid  potter wasn t
thinking about what they were about to do
thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me      i
third   to mr  harry potter      said dumbledore

thirty six   he said  looking up at his mother and
this   can this be
this   said wood   is the golden snitch  and it s the
this ball s called the quaffle   said wood   the
this boy was another good reason for keeping the
this by now  but it had given him a bit of a shock on
this didn t have quite the effect she d expected
this for years
this funny  because they were all so impressed at the
this is   it s devil s snare
this is boring   dudley moaned  he shuffled away
this is harry potter an  hermione granger  by the
this is it   ron moaned  as they pushed helplessly at

this is magic  i don t expect you will really understand
this is ron   harry told hagrid  who was pouring
this is the second time in a week  i found one dead
this is voldemort we re talking about  he d have found
this is where i leave you   firenze murmured as
this isn t safe   she might have gone for filch  i bet
this mirror is the key to finding the stone   quirrell
this needs thinking about       he said   i suppose
this only left one parcel  harry picked it up and felt
this son   i saw him kicking his mother all the way
this time  anyone want a bet  what about you
this time he had a girl with him  she was already
this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to
this was why harry spent as much time as possible
this was wonderful  he pulled his broomstick up a
this way
this way   harry mouthed to the others and
this way   said harry  pointing down a stone
this wizard  about twenty years ago now  started
thomas  dean   a black boy even taller than ron
thomas  who shared their dormitory  about soccer
those cold eyes  he had looked through his books at
those cunning folk use any means
those patient hufflepuffs are true
those people in the leaky cauldron  professor
those willing to let me into their hearts and minds
though  he had no choice  the cut had turned a nasty
though a large balloon was swelling inside him  he
though he needs reminding of that on his first day at
though he wasn t there   or rather  as though he was
though she didn t think this was the moment for

though they d never been touched
thought  edging a little closer to the glass  bright
thought  his heart sinking  but he still didn t open his
thought  in the weeks that followed he did seem to be
thought firenze didn t want to talk to him anymore
thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in
thought he was acting for the best   he said in his
thought of hagrid  expelled but allowed to stay on as
thought we d be copying lines or something  if my
thought wildly  that seemed the sort of thing
thought you wouldn t open a book before coming

thousands of books  thousands of shelves  hundreds
thousands of books surrounding them   i bet there s a
thrashing about in his crate  about ten minutes later
threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they

tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once
tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of
tiny ray of hope  when september came he would be

to him   an  he killed  em  horribly  one o  the only
to him when he s older  i ve written them a letter
to his bed
to his surprise  hagrid chuckled
to its knees  then it slumped to the ground  fast
to keep things friendly
to life  the horse pawed the ground and the knight
to listen to her  he d never been more nervous  never
to lock him in his cupboard  if he d once defeated the
to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his

to mention the second television and the racing bike
to one as young as you  i m sure it seems incredible
to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our
to power
to pull her toward the door  but she couldn t move
to pull it off but it tightened painfully   and there
to read it through  they got the right answers anyway
to remember   yeah     he asked what i did  an  i told
to return to power  who has clung to life  awaiting
to run first now that he had a bag full of money  he
to say a few words  and here they are  nitwit
to see a dragon hatching
to set fire to snape at that quidditch match  she
to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the
to steal food when he was here
to stop   the cart was out of control   he was a foot
to the day  harry thought  as he lay awake much later
to the dursleys saying that he d somehow turned his

to the girls  dormitories  harry and ron barely had
to the great hall  where professor mcgonagall and
to the left
to the lumpy bed next door  and harry was left to find
to the next day for the food and the fun  but not
to the note was a fifty pence piece
to think of anything else to do with him  but before
to touch the knights horse  at once  the stone sprang
to try since they d seen him make neville s toad zoom
to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching
to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to
to vibrate if you flew too high  or always flew slightly
to visit charlie
to with his brothers and the broomstick he d like to
to work it out  you fed draco malfoy some cock and
to yell and cheer as neville  white with shock
toad  was called  he fell over on his way to the stool
toad  who leapt out of sight

toast for breakfast the next day  they had just
toasting fork   bread  english muffins
together
together  his whole body rigid  he swayed where he

tonight
tonight  if you want  wizard s duel  wands only
tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me
too eager to fly again to wait for wood  harry
too excited and nervous to go back to sleep  he got up
too much  because he went back to staring out of the
took it curiously and read the first line  for a moment
took one look at the troll  let out a faint whimper  and
took the roll call  and when he reached harry s name
took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a
took yeh from the ruined house myself  on
toothless walnut  the low buzz of chatter stopped
top hat fell off in his excitement   you bowed to me
top of a multilevel parking garage
top of the marble staircase   if he hadn t stolen
top security vault  harry was sure  and he leaned
torches  it sloped steeply downward and there were
torches like the ones at gringotts  the ceiling was too
tore it open at once  it said  in a very untidy scrawl
torture  snape was so horrible to harry  could snape
touch a person marked by something so good
touch anything he gives you  dudley
touched goyle  goyle let out a horrible yell
toward him  he narrowed his wicked black eyes
toward madam malkin s robes for all occasions
toward the dungeon ceiling
toward the dursleys  house
toward the front door
toward the ground
toward the wall  harry leaned forward and with a
towered over the other little shops  standing beside
towers   they found their beds at last  five four

traffic lights  and it didn t stop there  within seconds

transfiguration is some of the most complex and
transfigured the chessmen to make them alive  that
trapdoor  all neville cared about was never going near
trapdoor  there was no sign of the bottom
trapdoor  which swung up and open
treacle tart  but he fell asleep almost at once
tree  as though the poor creature had been thrashing
tree  he steadied himself in time to hear snape say
tree  scattering needles everywhere and smirking
trees  a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked
tremble
trembling  excuses  alibis  and wild cover up stories
trembling  into armchairs
trembling  what if they lost
trembling fingers  inside was a large  sticky chocolate
trevor   cried neville blissfully  holding out his
trick of the light  mr  dursley blinked and stared at
tricky customer  eh  not to worry  well find the
tried  at breakfast on thursday she bored them all
tried not to look at malfoy  crabbe  and goyle  who
tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed  because

try and find them in the dark  to warn them
try it again in a hurry  and neville will play quidditch
try takin  the school  not jus  then  anyway
trying to break into it on purpose  and was
trying to buck him off  but nimbus two thousands
trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes
trying to disturb it all day long  it was worse than
trying to do  he shouted at harry for about half an
trying to find out how far i d got  he suspected me all
trying to find out who he is
trying to get a fly off the end  and a long golden
trying to get through all their extra work
trying to persuade people to call him by his proper

turned and saw the dursleys drive away  all three of
turned his head in every direction as they walked up
turned his helmeted head to look down at ron
turned over   it couldn t affect them
turned over  trying to get comfortable  his stomach
turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry
turned slowly back to the mirror
turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps
turned to hermione   can we help you with
turned to the twins
turned to their families
turned white   we ve got to go and see hagrid  now
turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy
turning all the armchairs into hunched black
turning its ugly snout toward ron instead  giving

two hours later  harry s huge  heavy trunk had been
two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him
two months  the castle felt more like home than
two more presents  is that all right
two of us will help you  whichever you would find

unbelievable  harry couldn t help trusting him
unblinkingly upward  then sighed again

uncle vernon  he had a large pink face  not much
uncle vernon  still ashen faced but looking very
uncle vernon  who had gone very pale  whispered
uncle vernon and aunt petunia  one for visitors
uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each
uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his
uncle vernon chuckled
uncle vernon didn t go to work that day  he stayed at
uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was
uncle vernon grunted again
uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening
uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to
uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise
uncle vernon made another funny noise  like a
uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front  he
uncle vernon ripped open the bill  snorted in disgust
uncle vernon roared  pulling aunt petunia and
uncle vernon s lap  harry could see three letters
uncle vernon s rations turned out to be a bag of chips
uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest

under her seat  or the scuffles and yelps coming from
under his weight  and began taking all sorts of things

under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had
under the table and a second later the hat had
under your feet  pelt you with bits of chalk  or sneak
underground  and complained loudly that the seats

when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling
when harry pulled back his sheets  he found his
when harry walked in there was a sudden hush  and
when he drew back a second later  there was a
when he had been younger  harry had dreamed and
when he realized that he d already been at hogwarts
when he was dressed he went down the hall into the
when he was indoors  hagrid looked too big to be
when hermione caught up with them

where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the
where is this school  anyway
where on earth have you all been   she asked
where s malfoy  in stinking slytherin
where s my letter   said harry  the moment uncle
where s percy   said their mother
where s the cannon   he said stupidly
where should he go  he stopped  his heart racing
where snape stood  and was now racing along the row
where the halloween decorations put hermione out of
where they are just and loyal
where they learned how to take care of all the strange
where those of wit and learning
where was i   said hagrid  but at that moment
where you ought to be
wherever he went
whether we be old and bald
which  aren t you
which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd
which had been bewitched with an anti cheating
which means   dumbledore called over the storm of
which one will get you back through the purple
which seemed very cold and gloomy after the
which she left  to hide that horrible scar   dudley had
which turned out to be a very interesting read
which was all very well  thought harry  but he had
which was difficult as there wasn t much room
which was fastened under his left ear  and on ron s
which was out of bounds except for classes  add
which was the only one taught by a ghost  professor
which way did they go  peeves   filch was saying
while copying down different ways of treating werewolf
while he drove  uncle vernon complained to aunt
while he was studyin  outta books but then he took a
while neville  who had been drenched in the potion
while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley
while they did this  but it was very difficult  he d
while they had been talking  the train had carried
while we were there
while you are waiting
whippy  try
whisk off for filch  who d appear  wheezing  two
whiskery kiss  then  suddenly  hagrid let out a howl
whisper  as if he thought voldemort could hear them
whisper about the potters
whisper to harry   but he ll have a harder time
whispered   i ll come back   and hurried from the
whispered  patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as
whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its
whispered hermione
whispering was coming from the books  as though
whispers followed harry from the moment he left his
whistle had touched madam hooch s lips
white always plays first in chess   said ron  peering
white as his

who d had enough of working  he came back a
who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him
who ever sent him letters  hagrid would never betray
who loved us is gone  will give us some protection
who never read anything  would have been wild to get

who says the centaurs are right  it sounds like
who sent it to me
who was circling the game like a hawk  looking for the
who was crouching  terrified  behind uncle vernon
who was mentioned  he supposed this was all part of
who was nearest and had no way to escape
who was scratching her nose  to open a bag of bertie
who wasn t in slytherin  you know who was one
who went     bad  as bad as you could go  worse
who would be staying for the holidays  and harry had
whole arm
whole castle
whole crowd was on its feet  watching  terrified  as the
whole minute before the hat declared him a
whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty
whom he seemed to like  he was just telling everyone
whoop from ron
whooped and clapped and mr  ollivander cried   oh
whose tail feather is in your wand  gave another
why
why   panted hermione  hurrying to keep up
why   said harry

why were you expelled
why would he want to kill me in the first place
why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts
wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as
wig
wild eyes looked straight through him  and harry
wild jerk and harry swung off it  he was now dangling
will always find their kind
will be most relieved you have come round  they have
will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek
will you stop messing around   he yelled   that s
will you stop saying the name   ron hissed
win at quidditch
wind must have caught him in mid jump
wind whistled in his ears  mingled with the
window
window  harry felt a great leap of excitement  he
window  it was getting dark  he could see mountains
window  pretending he hadn t looked  harry saw he
window  while uncle vernon made furious telephone
